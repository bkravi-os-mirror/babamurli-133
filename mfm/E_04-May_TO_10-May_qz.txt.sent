Sweet children, make your nature as easy as the Father's. You should not have any arrogance. Let your intellect be filled with knowledge, not arrogance.

Question:

How are some children even more babyish than babies when doing service?

Answer:

 Some children continue to do service and relate knowledge to others, but they don’t remember the Father. They say: Baba, I forget to remember You. So, Baba calls them more babyish than babies because children don’t normally forget their father. Why do you forget the Father who makes you into princes and princesses? If you forget Him, how can you claim your inheritance? While working with your hands, continue to remember the Father. Om shanti. The aim and objective of this study is in front of you children. You children know that the Father is in an ordinary body and that it is also an old body. There, even when they become old, they remain happy because they know that they are to become children again. This one also knows and has the happiness of knowing what he is going to become. The activity becomes like that of a child and remains as easy as a child. There is no arrogance etc. The intellect is knowledge-full. As is this one's (Brahma Baba's) intellect, so should yours be. Baba has come to teach us and we will become this. So, you children should have the happiness inside of shedding your bodies and then becoming that. We are studying Raja Yoga. Whether you are a young child or an old person, you will all shed your bodies. The study is the same for everyone. This one says: I too am studying Raja Yoga. Then I will go and become a prince. You also say that you will become princes and princesses. You are studying to become princes and princesses. Then, your final thoughts will lead you to your destination. Your intellects have the faith that you will become princes from beggars. This world of beggars is going to end. You children have to remain very happy. Baba makes you children equal to Himself. Shiv Baba says: I am not going to become a prince or princess. It is this Baba who says: I want to become that. I am studying this study in order to become that. This is Raja Yoga. You children also say that you will become princes and princesses. The Father says: That is absolutely right. May there be a rose in your mouth (May this happen practically). This is the exam for becoming princes and princesses. Knowledge is very easy. Remember the Father and the future inheritance. It is this remembrance that takes effort. By staying in this remembrance, your final thoughts will lead you to your destination. There is an example that sannyasis give. Someone was told to repeat to himself: I am a bull, I am a bull. Then he truly believed himself to be that. All of those things are useless. Here, it is a question of religion. The Father explains to you children: Knowledge is very easy, but there is effort in remembrance. Baba often says: You are a baby. Children then complain and ask: Am I really a baby? Baba says: Yes, you are a baby. Although you may very well have knowledge and you do service very well at the exhibitions day and night, nevertheless, I would say that you are a baby. The Father says: Even this Brahma is a baby. This Baba says: You are greater than I am. This one has many responsibilities. Those who have many responsibilities have many things to think about. Baba receives a great deal of news. That is why he wakes up early in the morning and tries to stay in remembrance. The inheritance has to be received from that One. Therefore, remember the Father. I explain to all the children every day: Sweet children, you are very weak in the pilgrimage of remembrance. You may be very good in knowledge, but each one of you has to ask your heart for how long you stay in remembrance of Baba. OK, you remain very busy in your work during the day but you can in fact stay in remembrance while doing your work. There is the saying "Let your hands do the work and let your heart be in remembrance". This means, let your intellect be connected there. It is just as on the path of devotion, when they sit down to worship, their intellects are distracted by their work etc. Or, if a woman’s husband is abroad, her intellect would then go there because she has a greater connection there. Therefore, even though you may be doing service very well, Baba still says that you have baby intellects. Many children write: I forget to remember Baba. Oh! Even a baby doesn’t forget his father! You are even more babyish than babies. The Father who makes you into princes and princesses is your Father, Teacher and Guru and yet you forget Him! Baba only advises the children who send their full charts to Him. You children should write to the Father telling Him how you remember Him and when you remember Him. Then the Father can advise you. Depending on the type of service (job) you do, Baba can understand how much spare time you have for remembrance. Those who have a government job have a lot of spare time. As soon as the workload lightens a little, you can continue to remember the Father. Whilst walking and moving around, let there be remembrance of the Father. Baba gives you the time. OK, go to sleep at 9.00 pm and then wake up at 2.00 or 3.00 in the morning and remember Baba. Come and sit here. Baba doesn’t want you to make it a habit of only sitting down for remembrance, because you can have remembrance whilst walking and moving around too. You children have a lot of spare time here. Previously, you used to go up in the hills and sit in solitude. You definitely have to remember the Father. How else would your sins be absolved? If you are unable to remember the Father, you are more babyish than babies. Everything depends on remembrance. Effort lies in remembering the Purifier Father. Knowledge is very easy. You know that only those who came a cycle ago will come and understand this knowledge again. You children continue to receive directions. The only effort you have to make is how to become satopradhan from tamopradhan. There is no way to do this other than by having remembrance of the Father. You can tell Baba: Baba, because this is my business or because of this job, I am unable to remember You. Baba would immediately advise you: Don’t do that, but do this. Everything of yours depends on remembrance. Many good children give knowledge very well and they make everyone happy, but they don't have any yoga. Although they understand that they have to remember the Father, they forget. This takes effort. Once you have imbibed this habit, then, even when you are sitting on board a plane or a train, you would have the internal concern to stay in remembrance. There would be the happiness inside that you are being made into the future princes and princesses by Baba. Wake up early in the morning and sit in remembrance of the Father. Then, if you get tired, you can lie down and remember Baba. The Father shows you many ways. If you are unable to remember Baba while walking and moving around, Baba would say: OK, sit for special remembrance at night so that you can at least accumulate something. However, to force yourself to sit somewhere to have meditation becomes like hatha yoga. Your path is an easy one. While eating your meal, remember the Father. We are being made into the masters of the world by Baba. Continue to talk to yourself: I am becoming that through this study. Pay full attention to your study. You have very few subjects. Baba explains very little. If you don’t understand anything, then ask Baba. Consider yourselves to be souls. These bodies are made of the five elements. To consider yourself to be a body means to consider yourself to be a ghost of the five elements. This is the devilish world and that is the divine world. Here, all are body conscious. No one knows himself to be a soul. There is always wrong and right. To understand yourself to be an imperishable soul is right understanding. To consider yourself to be a perishable body is wrong understanding. There is great arrogance of the body. The Father now says: Forget your bodies! Become soul conscious! There is effort in this. You have taken 84 births. You now have to return home. You find it very easy because you take 84 births. You have to write correctly that the deities of the sun dynasty take 84 births. You children continue to study and corrections also continue to take place. It is numberwise in a worldly study too. If you study less, you will receive a smaller salary. You children have now come to Baba to listen to the true story of immortality in order to become Narayan from an ordinary human. This land of death is now to be destroyed. We now have to go to the land of immortality. You children should be concerned about how to become satopradhan from tamopradhan, pure from impure. The Purifier Father shows all the children the same method. He simply says: Remember the Father and write your chart and you will be very happy. You now have knowledge whereas the world is in immense darkness. You are now receiving enlightenment. You are becoming trinetri and trikaldarshi. There are many people who say that knowledge can be received anywhere, that this is nothing new. Oh! But no one else receives this knowledge; and, even if they do receive knowledge somewhere, they don’t do anything with it. Does anyone else make effort to change from an ordinary man into Narayan? Not at all! The Father tells you children that the early morning hours are very good. You get a lot of pleasure as everything is peaceful and the atmosphere remains very good. The worst atmosphere is from 10.00 pm to midnight. This is why the morning time is very good. Go to sleep early and then wake up at 2.00 or 3.00 am. Sit comfortably and talk to Baba. Remember the history and geography of the world. Shiv Baba says: I have the knowledge of the Creator and creation. I become the Teacher and teach you. You souls continue to remember the Father. The ancient yoga of Bharat is very well known. You also have to write who that yoga is with. It is the yoga of souls with the Supreme Soul; in other words it is remembrance. You children know that you are all-rounders who take the full 84 births. Only those who belong to the Brahmin clan will come here. We are Brahmins and we are now going to become deities. Saraswati too is this one's daughter. I am old, but I am very happy that I am now to leave this body and take birth to a king. I am now studying and I will then have a golden spoon in the mouth. This is the aim and objective of all of you. Why should there not be happiness? No matter what people say, why should your happiness be lost? If you don’t remember the Father, how can you become Narayan from an ordinary man? You have to become elevated, do you not? Show that you can make such effort. Why do you become confused? Why do you become disheartened saying that not everyone will become a king? The moment you have the thought that not everyone is going to become a king, you fail. When they study in a college to become barristers or engineers, they don’t say that not everyone will become a barrister. If they don’t study, they fail. The whole rosary is of 16,108. Who will come first? That will depend on your efforts. Each of you is making more effort than the next. It is now in the intellects of you children that you are to leave your old bodies and return home. If you just remember this much, your efforts will become intense. It should remain in the intellects of you children that the Bestower of Liberation and Liberation-in-Life for all is the one Father. Today, there are so many billions of people in the world and there will then only be 900,000 of you. This is just an approximation. How many more could there be in the golden age? Because it is a kingdom that is being established, there also have to be subjects. The intellect says: In the golden age, the tree is very small; it is beautiful. The very name is heaven, Paradise. The whole cycle continues to rotate in the intellects of you children. If you continue to turn it around all the time, that is very good. This cough that comes is the suffering of karma because this is an old shoe. I am not going to receive a new one here. Shiv Baba says: I neither take rebirth nor enter a womb. I enter an ordinary old body. You are now in your stage of retirement and you have to go beyond sound to the land of peace. Just as the day ends and changes into the night and the night ends and changes into the day, in the same way, this old world is definitely going to be destroyed. The golden age will definitely come when the confluence age ends. You children have to pay a lot of attention to the pilgrimage of remembrance. This is greatly lacking at present. This is why Baba calls you babies. You show your baby-like natures. When you say that you are unable to remember Baba, you would be called a baby, would you not? Are you such small babies that you forget the Father? He is the sweetest Father, Teacher and Guru. He is your most Beloved for half the cycle, and yet you forget Him! For half the cycle, you have been remembering Him when you were in sorrow, saying: O God! The soul says this through the body. Now that I have come, remember Me very well. Show the path to many others. As you make further progress, there will be a lot of expansion. Religions do expand. There is the example of Aurobindo Ghose. Today, he has so many centres. You now know that all of that belongs to the path of devotion. You are now receiving knowledge. This is the knowledge of how to become the most elevated human beings. You are changing from human beings into deities. The Father comes and cleans all the dirty impure clothes. This praise only belongs to Him. The main thing is remembrance. Knowledge is very easy. Read the murli to others. Continue to remember the Father. While remembering the Father, you souls will become pure and continue to be filled with petrol. Then you souls will run. You can call them part of Shiv Baba’s procession or His children. The Father says: I have now come to remove you from the pyre of lust and seat you on the pyre of yoga. You receive health through yoga and wealth through knowledge. Achcha.

To the sweetest, beloved, long-lost and now-found children, love, remembrance and good morning from the Mother, the Father, BapDada. The spiritual Father says namaste to the spiritual children.

Essence for dharna:   Keep your aim and objective in front of you and remain happy. Never become disheartened. Never have the thought that not everyone is going to become a king. Make effort to claim a high status.      Remember the most beloved Father with a lot of love. Do not become a baby in this. The early morning is a very good time for having remembrance. Sit comfortably in silence and remember Baba.

Blessing:

May you become an embodiment of success by making your stage free from wasteful and sinful thoughts with your specialities of unity and concentration.

In order to be blessed with success in the task of revealing BapDada, always be united and reveal the One. One finger of co-operation has been shown as a sign of unity. Then, with concentration, that is, when your stage is constantly free from wasteful and sinful thoughts, success becomes a garland around your neck. However, for this, you must constantly remember the slogan: Neither will I be a problem nor will I fluctuate on seeing a problem. I will always remain an embodiment of solutions.

Slogan:

Stay under BapDada’s canopy of protection and Maya cannot cast a shadow over you.

Sweet children, your love is for the one Father because you receive the unlimited inheritance from Him. You say to Him with love, "My Baba!”

Question:

Why can no words spoken by human beings be compared to those spoken by the Father?

Answer:

 Because every word that the Father speaks is an elevated version. Those who hear these elevated versions become great; they become the most elevated humans. The Father’s elevated versions make you into beautiful flowers. Words spoken by human beings are not elevated versions. In fact, it is because of them that you have been coming down.

Song:

Even though the world may change, we will remain constant. Om shanti. The first line of the song is meaningful, but the rest of the song is useless. It's similar to how the terms in the Gita "God speaks", "Manmanabhav" and "Madhyajibhav” are correct. That is called a pinch of salt in a sackful of flour. You children know very well who God is. Shiv Baba is called God. Shiv Baba comes and creates Shivalaya. Where does He come? Into the brothel. He Himself comes and says: O My sweetest, beloved, long-lost and now-found spiritual children. It is you souls who listen to Him. You souls know that you are imperishable and that your bodies are perishable. We souls are now listening to these elevated versions spoken by the Supreme Father, the Supreme Soul. Only the Supreme Father, the Supreme Soul, speaks the elevated versions which make us into elevated human beings. None of the great souls and gurus etc. speak elevated versions. When they say, "Shivohum”, that too is not a true version. You are now listening to elevated versions from the Father and becoming beautiful flowers. There is so much difference between thorns and flowers! You children now know that it is not a human being who is speaking to you. Shiv Baba is present in this one. He too is a soul, but He is called the Supreme Soul. Impure souls now call out: O Supreme Soul, come! Come and purify us. He is the Supreme Father, the One who makes us into supreme beings. You are becoming the most elevated of all human beings, those who are called deities. The term "Supreme Father” is very sweet. When they refer to Him as omnipresent, there is no sweetness. Very few of you have remembrance of the Father inside you with a lot of love. Physical husbands and wives remember one another physically. Here, you souls have to remember the Supreme Soul with a lot of love. On the path of devotion, they cannot worship Him with as much love. There isn’t that love. How can they love Him when they don’t know Him? You children now have a lot of love for Him. You souls say: My Baba. All souls are brothers. Each brother says that Baba has given us His introduction. However, that wouldn't be called love. You would have love for someone from whom you receive something. Children love their father because they receive an inheritance from him. The greater the inheritance, the greater the love his children would have. If their father doesn’t have any property, but their grandfather does, there wouldn’t be as much love for the father. There would be more love for the grandfather, because they believe that they will receive some money from him. Now, this One is the unlimited Father. You children know that the Father is now teaching you. This is a matter of great happiness: God is my Father. No one knows that Father, the Creator. Because of not knowing Him, they call themselves the Father. If you ask a child who his father is, in the end, he would say, "I am.” You children now know that that One is definitely the Father of all fathers. The unlimited Father whom we have now found has no father of His own. That is the highest-on-high Father. Therefore, you children should have a lot of happiness inside you. When people go on those pilgrimages, there isn’t that much happiness because there is no attainment there. They simply go there to have a vision. They stumble along so much for nothing. They wear out their foreheads and they also use up all their money. They spend a lot of money and yet attain nothing. If there were an income earned on the path of devotion, the people of Bharat would become so wealthy. They spend billions of rupees on building temples etc. You didn’t just have one temple to Somnath; each king had a temple. You were given so much wealth. Five thousand years ago, you were made into the masters of the world. Only the Father says this. Five thousand years before today, I taught you Raja Yoga and made you become like them. Look what you have now become! Let this enter your intellects. We were so elevated! Having taken 84 births, we have now fallen to the floor; we have become as worthless as shells. We are now going to Baba who is making us into the masters of the world. This is the only pilgrimage where souls meet their Father. Therefore, there has to be that love inside you. When you children come here, your intellects should have the awareness that you are going to that Father from whom you are once again to receive the sovereignty of the world. That Father gives us the teachings: Children, imbibe divine virtues! Remember Me, the Father, the Almighty Authority, the Purifier! I come every cycle and tell you: Constantly remember Me alone and your sins will be absolved. Let it enter your hearts that you are going to the unlimited Father. The Father says: I am incognito. The soul says: I am incognito. You understand that you are going to Shiv Baba and Brahma Dada; they are combined. We are going to meet the One who makes us into the masters of the world. Let there be unlimited internal happiness. When you leave your homes to come here to Madhuban, happiness should be bubbling inside you. The Father has come to teach us and He is showing us the way to imbibe divine virtues. When you leave your homes you should have this happiness inside you. When a girl is going to meet her future husband, she puts on jewellery etc. and her face blossoms; her face blossoms for receiving sorrow! Your faces blossom for receiving constant happiness. Therefore, there should be so much happiness in coming to meet such a Father. We have now found the unlimited Father. When we go to the golden age, our degrees will decrease. You Brahmins are now the children of God. God sits here and teaches you. He is our Father and also our Teacher. He is teaching us and purifying us and He will then take us back home with Him. We souls are now being liberated from this dirty kingdom of Ravan. There should be a lot of happiness inside you. Since the Father makes you into the masters of the world, you should study very well. When students study well, they pass with good marks. Children say: Baba, I will become Shri Narayan. This is the true story of becoming the true Narayan. It is the story of changing from an ordinary human into Narayan. You have been listening to those false stories for birth after birth. Only once, at this time, do you listen to the true story from the Father. That then continues on the path of devotion. It is said that Shiv Baba took birth at night and so they celebrate His birthday year after year. However, no one knows when He came or what He did when He came. Achcha, they also celebrate the birth of Krishna. They don’t know when he came, how he came or what he did either. They say that he came in the land of Kans. How could he take birth in an impure land? You children should be so happy that you are going to the unlimited Father. Some relate their experience of how so-and-so shot an arrow at them and told them that Baba has come. Ever since that day, they have continued to remember the Father alone. This pilgrimage is for you to go to the greatest of all Fathers. Baba is living and He comes to meet His children. Those pilgrimages are physical. Here, the Father is living. Just as we souls speak through our bodies, so the Father, the Supreme Soul, also has to speak through a body. This study is for your livelihood of your future 21 births. Other studies are just for this one birth. So, which study should you study and which occupation should you have? The Father says: Do both! You mustn’t leave your home and families and go to live in the forests like the sannyasis do. This path is the family path. This study is for both. Not everyone will study. Some will study very well and some a little less. An arrow will instantly pierce some, whereas others will continue to speak as though they are crazy. Some say: Yes, I will try to understand. Others say: I have to understand these matters by sitting in solitude somewhere. Then they go off and disappear. If an arrow of knowledge strikes someone, he would immediately come to understand everything. Some say that they don’t have time. You can understand from that that an arrow didn't strike them. Look how Baba instantly left everything when an arrow pierced him! He believed that he was going to receive a sovereignty. Therefore, he thought, "What is all of this compared to that? I want to claim the kingdom from the Father.” The Father says: Now, carry on with your business etc., but come and understand all of this very well for one week. You have to look after your family and sustain your creation. Those people (sannyasis) create their family and then leave home and run away. The Father says: You created your creation. Therefore, look after them very well. If your wife and children listen to you, they are obedient and worthy. If they don’t, they are disobedient and unworthy. You can tell which ones are worthy and which ones are unworthy. The Father says: If you follow shrimat, you become elevated. Otherwise, you cannot receive the inheritance. Become pure, become a worthy child and glorify the Father’s name. Once an arrow has struck them, they will say: That’s it! I will now earn a true income. The Father has come to take you to Shivalaya. You also have to become worthy of going to Shivalaya. There is effort in this. Tell them: Now remember Shiv Baba. Death is standing just ahead. They too have to be benefitted. Tell them: Now remember the Father and your sins will be absolved. It is the duty of you daughters to uplift both your family and your in-laws' family. Since you have been invited there, it is your duty to benefit them. Become merciful. Show impure and tamopradhan human beings the way to become satopradhan. You know that everything definitely becomes old from new. In hell, all souls are impure. Therefore, they go to bathe in the Ganges in order to be purified. However, first of all, they have to be made to understand that they are impure and that they therefore have to become pure. The Father says to souls: Remember Me and your sins will be absolved. Give all the sages and holy men My message: The Father says: Remember Me! The alloy will continue to be removed from souls with this fire of yoga or pilgrimage of remembrance. You will then be purified and come to Me. I will take all of you back home with Me. A scorpion continues to move along until it comes to something soft. Then, it will sting there. What would it achieve by stinging a stone? You can also give the Father's introduction. The Father has told you where His devotees are. They are at the temples to Shiva, the temples to Krishna and the temples to Lakshmi and Narayan. Devotees continue to worship Me. They too are My children. They also received the kingdom from Me but have now become worshippers from being worthy of worship. They are devotees of the deities too. The number one worship is the unadulterated worship of Shiva. While gradually falling, they started to worship the elements. It is easy to explain to the worshippers of Shiva: This is Shiv Baba, the Father of all souls. He gives us the inheritance of heaven. The Father says: Now remember Me and your sins will be absolved. I am giving you this message. The Father says: I am the Purifier, the Ocean of Knowledge. I am giving you this knowledge. I also teach you yoga in order to purify you. I give you this message through the body of Brahma: Remember Me! Remember your 84 births! You will find the devotees in the temples and at the kumbha melas. You can explain there whether the Ganges or the Supreme Soul is the Purifier. Therefore, you children should have the happiness of who it is you are going to. He is so ordinary! What splendour should He reveal? What should Shiv Baba do so that He seems like a great person? He cannot wear saffron robes. The Father says: I take an ordinary body. Advise Me what to do! How should I decorate this chariot? When they ride the horse of Hussein, they decorate it so beautifully. Here, they portray Shiv Baba’s chariot as a bull. They also put a round image of Shiva on the forehead of a bull. How could Shiv Baba enter a bull? Why have they shown a bull in the temples? They say that that is the chariot of Shankar. Would Shankar have a chariot in the subtle region? All of that belongs to the path of devotion and is fixed in the drama. Achcha.

To the sweetest, beloved, long-lost and now-found children, love, remembrance and good morning from the Mother, the Father, BapDada. The spiritual Father says namaste to the spiritual children.

Essence for dharna:   Promise yourself that 1) You will now earn a true income. 2) You will make yourself worthy of going to Shivalaya. 3) You will become a worthy child by following shrimat and glorify the Father’s name.      Become merciful and make tamopradhan human beings satopradhan. Benefit everyone. Remind everyone of the Father before death comes.

Blessing:

May you become great in serving with the lesson of "Ha ji” (yes indeed) and become worthy of receiving everyone’s blessings.

While doing service in happiness and with enthusiasm, also pay attention to the way you do service so that you also receive everyone’s blessings because where there are blessings, there will not be hard work. Now, simply have the aim of receiving blessings from those you come into contact with. The lesson of "Ha ji” is the means of receiving blessings. Even if some are wrong, do not push them down further by saying that they are wrong, but give them support and enable them to stand up. Be co-operative and you will receive blessings from their contentment. Those who become great in receiving blessings become great automatically.

Slogan:

As well as being a hard worker, also keep the aim of becoming hard (strong) in your stage.

Sweet children, check yourself to see whether you have become a flower. Check that you don’t become a thorn by having arrogance of the body. The Father has come to change you from thorns into flowers.

Question:

On the basis of which faith are you able to have unbroken love for the Father?

Answer:

 When you first have the faith that you are a soul, you will have love for the Father. You need to have the unbroken faith that the incorporeal Father is present in this lucky chariot. He is teaching us through this one. When this faith breaks, your love decreases. Om shanti. God, the One who changes thorns into flowers, speaks; that is, God, the Master of the Garden, speaks. You children know that you have come here to change from thorns into flowers. All of you understand that you were previously thorns and that you are now becoming flowers. The Father is praised a lot: They say: Purifier, come! He is the Boatman, the Master of the Garden and the Redeemer of Souls. Although He is referred to by many names, the same image of Him is seen everywhere. His praise is sung as the Ocean of Knowledge, the Ocean of Happiness. You know that you are now sitting with that one Father. You have come here to change from thorn-like humans into flower-like deities. This is your aim and objective. Now, each of you has to look within your own heart and ask yourself: Do I have divine virtues? Have I become full of all virtues? Previously, you used to sing praise of the deities and considered yourselves to be thorns. Because you have the five vices, you used to sing: I am without virtue, I have no virtues. Body consciousness is also a very strong form of ego. When you consider yourselves to be souls, there can be a lot of love for the Father. You now know that the incorporeal Father is present in this chariot. Even after your having this faith, it breaks. You say that you have come to Shiv Baba who is in the body of this lucky chariot of Prajapita Brahma. The Father of all of us souls is only one Shiv Baba and He is present in this chariot. This faith has to be very firm. It is in this that Maya brings doubt. When a kumari becomes engaged and is to be wed, she believes she will receive a lot of happiness from her husband, but what happiness does she receive? She immediately becomes impure. Whilst she is still a kumari, her mother, her father etc. all bow down to her because she is pure. As soon as she becomes impure, she has to start bowing down to everyone. Today, everyone is bowing down to her, and, tomorrow, she will be bowing down to everyone. You children are now at the confluence age and are becoming the most elevated of human beings. Where will you be tomorrow? What are these homes etc. today? There is so much dirty activity everywhere. This is called the brothel; everyone is born through vice. Only you lived in the Temple of Shiva. Five thousand years ago, you were very happy. There was no name or trace of sorrow. You have now come here to become like that once again. People do not know about the Temple of Shiva at all. Heaven is called the Temple of Shiva. Shiv Baba established heaven. Everyone says, "Baba”, but ask them where the Father is and they will say that He is omnipresent. They say that He is in the cats and dogs and the fish and crocodiles. There is so much difference! The Father says: You were once the most elevated human beings, but, having taken your 84 births, what have you now become? You have become residents of hell. This is why everyone calls out: O Purifier, come! The Father has now come to purify everyone. He says: Stop drinking poison in this last birth. However, they still do not understand. The Father of all souls now says: Become pure! Everyone says "Baba”. First of all, souls remember that Baba and then they remember this Baba. That Baba is the incorporeal One and this Baba is a corporeal one. The Supreme Soul sits here and explains to you impure souls. Initially, you too were pure. You used to live with the Father and then you came here to play your parts. Understand this cycle very well. You are now to go to the new world of the golden age. It is your desire to go to heaven. You used to ask for a child like Krishna. I have now come to make you become like him. There, all children are like Krishna; they are satopradhan flowers. You are now going to the land of Krishna; you are becoming the masters of heaven. Ask yourself: Have I become a flower? Do I become a thorn by having arrogance of the body? Human beings consider themselves to be bodies rather than souls. By forgetting that you are souls, you have forgotten the Father. It is only by coming to know the Father from the Father that you can claim the Father’s inheritance. Everyone receives his inheritance from the unlimited Father. There isn’t a single soul who doesn’t receive his inheritance. It is only the Father who comes and purifies everyone and takes them back home to the land of nirvana. They say that the light merged into the light or into the brahm element. They have no knowledge at all. You know to whom you have come. This company of the Truth (satsang) is not of a human being. You souls became separated from the Supreme Soul and you have now found His company. Only once in 5000 years do you receive the true company of the Truth. There are no satsangs in the golden and silver ages. However, on the path of devotion, there are many satsangs. In fact, only the one Father is the Truth. You are now sitting in His company. You should have the awareness that you are Godly students and that God is teaching you. This too is your great fortune. Our Baba is here. He becomes the Father, Teacher and Guru. It is at this time that He plays all three parts. He makes you children belong to Him. The Father says: It is by having remembrance that your sins can be absolved. By remembering the Father your sins will be absolved and you will then receive a crown of light. That is just a symbol; it isn’t that you can see light. It is a symbol of purity. No one else can receive this knowledge. Only the one Father gives it. He has the full knowledge. The Father says: I am the Seed of the human world tree. This is an inverted tree. This is the kalpa tree. Previously, there was the tree of divine flowers. It has now become a forest of thorns because of the five vices. The foremost vice is body consciousness. There is no body consciousness there. There, they do understand that they are souls, but they do not know the Father, the Supreme Soul. All they know is that they are souls; that's all. They do not have any other knowledge. You have now been told that your skin has become old over many births and is now decayed. You now have to shed it (The example of the snake). At this time, both souls and bodies are impure. When you souls become pure, you will shed your bodies. All souls will run home. You now have the knowledge that this drama is coming to an end. We now have to return home with the Father. Therefore, we have to remember the home. These bodies have to be renounced. When the bodies are destroyed, the world too will be destroyed and you will then go to your new home and develop new relationships. Those people will have to take rebirth here, whereas you will take it in the world of flowers. Deities are pure. You understand that you were flowers, that you then became thorns and that you are once again going to the world of flowers. As you make further progress you will have many visions. Those are all games. Meera used to dance in trance, but she had no knowledge. Meera did not go to heaven; she would still be here somewhere. If she belongs to this Brahmin clan, she is receiving this knowledge somewhere. It isn’t that, because she danced in trance, she went to heaven. Many people danced in the same way. They would go into trance and, having seen everything, would return and then indulge in vice. It is remembered, "If you ascend, you taste the sweetness of heaven but if you descend….." The Father reassures you that you can become the masters of heaven if you study this knowledge and yoga. If you leave the Father, you fall into the gutter (vice). There were those who became amazed and belonged to the Father. They listened to this knowledge and related it to everyone. Then they ran away. They are being hurt so badly by Maya. Now, by following the Father’s shrimat, you are becoming deities. Both souls and bodies have to become elevated. Deities do not take birth through vice. That world is the viceless world. The five vices do not exist there. Shiv Baba created heaven. It is now hell. You have now come here to become the residents of heaven once again. Those who study well will go to heaven. You are studying once again and will continue to study cycle after cycle. This cycle continues to turn. This is the predestined drama from which no one can be liberated. Whatever you see, for instance, a mosquito flying, it will fly in the same way after a cycle. A very good intellect is needed to understand this. The shooting of this drama continues to take place. This is the field of action. You come here from the supreme abode to play your parts. Some of you become very clever in this study and some are still studying. Some study and become even cleverer than the older ones. The Ocean of Knowledge teaches everyone. As soon as you belong to the Father, the inheritance of the world is yours. Yes, souls that have become impure definitely do have to be purified. The easiest way to become pure is to continue to remember the unlimited Father. You children should have disinterest in the old world. Then, there is the land of liberation and the land of liberation-in-life. We do not remember anyone but the one Father. Wake up early in the morning and practise: I came bodiless and I have to return bodiless. Therefore, why should I remember any bodily beings? Wake up at amrit vela and talk to yourself in this way. The early morning hours are called amrit vela. The Ocean of Knowledge has the nectar of knowledge. Therefore, the Ocean of Knowledge says: The early morning time is very good. Wake up early in the morning and remember the Father with a lot of love: Baba, I have now found You again after 5000 years. The Father says: Now remember Me and your sins will be absolved. You have to follow shrimat. You definitely do have to become satopradhan. Once you develop the habit of remembering the Father, you will continue to be in a state of happiness and any consciousness of the body will continue to be removed. There will then be no consciousness of the body; there will be a great deal of happiness. You were very happy when you were pure. All of this knowledge should be retained in your intellects. Those who come first would definitely take 84 births. Then, those of the moon dynasty would take a few births less and then those of Islam would take even fewer births. The tree continues to grow, numberwise. The main religion is the deity religion. Later, three religions emerge from this one. Then, the branches and twigs emerge. You now know this drama. This drama continues to move as slowly as a louse; it continues to tick away, second by second. That is why "Liberation in a second" has been remembered. Souls remember their Father: Baba, we are Your children. We should therefore be in heaven. So why are we in hell? The Father establishes heaven, so why are we still in hell? The Father explains: You were in heaven. You have now forgotten everything by taking 84 births. Now, follow My directions once again. It is only by having remembrance of the Father that yours sins will be absolved. Alloy has been mixed into souls. Bodies are the ornaments of the souls. When souls become pure, they receive pure bodies. You know that you were in heaven. Now that the Father has come once again, you have to claim your full inheritance from Him. The five vices have to be renounced. Body consciousness has to be renounced. While doing everything, continue to remember the Father. Souls have been remembering their Beloved for half the cycle. That Beloved has now come. He says: You have become ugly by sitting on the pyre of lust. I have now come to make you beautiful. This is what the fire of yoga is for. Knowledge wouldn't be called a pyre. There is the pyre of this yoga. By sitting on the pyre of remembrance, your sins will be absolved. Gyan is called knowledge. The Father is telling you the knowledge of the beginning, middle and end of the world. The Highest on High is the Father. Then there are Brahma, Vishnu and Shankar and then those of the sun and moon dynasties. Then there are the by-plots of other religions. This tree grows so large. This tree has no foundation at this time. This is why the example of the banyan tree is given. The deity religion has disappeared. People have become corrupt in their religion and their actions. You children are now performing elevated actions in order to become elevated. You are making your eyes civil. You must no longer perform corrupt actions; there should be no bad vision. Check yourself: Am I worthy of marrying Lakshmi? Do I consider myself to be a soul anddo I remember the Father? Examine your chart every day and ask yourself: Throughout the day, did I become body conscious and commit any sin? If so, there will be one hundred-fold punishment. Maya does not allow you to keep your chart. You write it for two to four days and then stop. The Father is very much concerned. He has mercy. He feels that if you children were to remember Him, your sins would be absolved. This does require effort. You mustn’t make a loss for yourself. Knowledge is very easy. Achcha.

To the sweetest, beloved, long-lost and now-found children, love, remembrance and good morning from the Mother, the Father, BapDada. The spiritual Father says namaste to the spiritual children.

Essence for dharna:   Wake up at amrit vela and have a sweet conversation with the Father. Practise becoming bodiless. Pay attention to remembering no one but the Father.      Make your vision very clean and pure. The garden of divine flowers is being created. Therefore, make full effort to become a flower. Do not become a thorn.

Blessing:

May you be a constant server who serves at every moment through your every thought, attitude and actions.

Just as you find the Father extremely lovely, and that there is no life without the Father, in the same way, there is no life without service. As well as being a constant yogi, also be a constant server. Do service even while sleeping. When you are seen sleeping, let them see peace on your face and experience vibrations of bliss. Continue to do the service of reminding everyone to have remembrance of the Father with every one of your physical organs. Continue to spread vibrations with your powerful attitude. Continue to give blessings to become a karma yogi with your actions. Continue to accumulate multi-millions at every step and you would then be said to be a constant server and serviceable.

Remain aware of your spiritual personality and you will become a conqueror of Maya.

Sweet children, only shrimat can make you elevated. Therefore, never forget shrimat. Renounce the dictates of your own minds and follow the one Father’s directions.

Question:

What is the way to become a charitable soul?

Answer:

 In order to become a charitable soul, remember the one Father with love and with an honest heart. Do not carry out any sinful act with your physical organs. Show everyone the path. Ask your heart: How much charity do I perform? Check that you do not perform any acts for which you would have to experience one hundred-fold punishment. By checking yourself in this way, you can become a charitable soul. Om shanti. The spiritual Father sits here and explains to you children. You children know that you are now following Shiv Baba’s directions. His directions are the highest of all. People of the world do not know how Shiv Baba, the highest of all, gives His children elevated directions to make them elevated. In this kingdom of Ravan, no human being can give human beings elevated directions. You now have become those who receive God’s directions. You children are now receiving God’s directions in order to become pure from impure. You now know that you used to be the masters of the world. This Brahma, who was the master, did not know this either. The master of the world then becomes completely impure. You have to use your intellect to understand this play very well. The intellect battles in trying to understand what is right and what is wrong. The whole world is wrong. Only the one Father is right. Only He speaks the truth. He makes you into the masters of the land of truth, and so you should take His directions. By following your own dictates, you will be deceived. However, He is incognito. He is the incorporeal One. Many children make the mistake of thinking that these directions come from Dada. Maya doesn’t allow them to accept elevated directions. You should follow shrimat, should you not? Baba, we will definitely accept whatever You tell us. However, some of you don’t accept this. You follow God’s directions, numberwise, according to the efforts you make, and the rest follow their own dictates. Baba has come here to give you elevated directions. You repeatedly forget such a Father. Maya doesn’t allow you to take His directions. Shrimat is very easy. No one in the world understands that they are tamopradhan. My directions are very famous; the Shrimad Bhagawad Gita. God now says: I have come after 5000 years. I come and give Bharat shrimat and make it into the most elevated land of all. The Father cautions you but some children do not follow shrimat! The Father says every day: Children, do not forget to follow shrimat. It is not a question of this Brahma. Understand what that One is telling you. That One gives directions through this one. It is that One who explains. He doesn’t eat or drink. He says: I am beyond experiencing anything. I give you children shrimat. The foremost shrimat He gives is: Remember Me! Do not perform any sinful act! Ask your heart how much sin you have committed. You know that the urn of sin on everyone is now full. At present, everyone is on the wrong path. You have now found the right path through the Father. The entire knowledge is now in your intellects. The knowledge that should be in the Gita isn’t there. That Gita wasn’t created by the Father. That too is fixed on the path of devotion. It is said that God will come and give you the fruit of your devotion. It has been explained to you children that you receive salvation through knowledge. Everyone receives salvation and then everyone becomes degraded. This world is tamopradhan; no one is satopradhan. Having been taking rebirth, you have now reached the end. Death is now over everyone’s head. This applies to Bharat alone. The Gita is the scripture of the deity religion. So, what benefit would you receive by going into other religions? Those of other religions study their own Koran or Bible etc. They know their own religion. It is only the people of Bharat who have gone into other religions. All others are firm in their own religions. The features of those of all the different religions are distinct. The Father reminds you children that you have forgotten your deity religion. You were the deities of heaven. The Father has told you people of Bharat the meaning of "hum so”. It isn’t that souls are the Supreme Soul. It was the gurus of the path of devotion who created those stories. There are millions of gurus. A woman is told that her husband is her guru and her god. If her husband were her god, why would she call out, "O God! O Rama!”? People’s intellects have turned completely to stone. This one himself says: I too was like that. There is such a vast difference between being the master of Vaikunth (Paradise), Shri Krishna, and being called a village urchin. They speak of Shyam and Sundar, but they don’t understand the meaning of that. The Father has now explained to you that the one who was number one satopradhan, Sundar (beautiful), then becomes the last, most tamopradhan one, Shyam (ugly). You understand that you were beautiful and that you have now become ugly. You have been around the cycle of 84 births. The Father now gives you just the one medicine to make you beautiful from ugly: Remember Me and you souls will become pure from impure. Your sins of many births will be absolved. You know that you became sinful souls ever since Ravan came and that you have continued to fall. This is the world of sinful souls. Not a single one is beautiful. No one but the Father can make you beautiful. You have come here to become beautiful residents of heaven. At present you are ugly residents of hell. You became ugly by sitting on the pyre of lust. The Father says: Lust is your greatest enemy. Those who conquer it will conquer the world. The number one vice is lust. Only such souls are said to be impure. You wouldn’t call those who have anger impure. You called out to the Father to come and make you pure from impure. Therefore, the Father has now come and He says: Become pure in this last birth. Just as day comes after night and night comes after day, so too, the golden age has to come after the confluence age; the cycle has to turn. However, there is no other world in the sky or under the earth; this is the only world. The golden, silver, copper and iron ages exist here. There is also only one tree; there isn’t another. It is a lie when people say that there are many worlds. The Father says: All of those stories belong to the path of devotion. The Father is now telling you the truth. Look inside yourself and ask: How much do I follow shrimat to become satopradhan, that is, to become a charitable soul? A satopradhan soul is called a charitable soul and a tamopradhan soul is called a sinful soul. It is a sin to indulge in vice. The Father says: Now become pure! Now that you belong to Me, follow My directions! The main thing is not to commit any further sin. The foremost sin is to indulge in vice. Then many other sins are committed. There is a lot of stealing, cheating etc. The Government catches many of them. The Father is now telling each of you children: Look inside your heart and ask yourself: Am I committing sin? Just because Baba is Janijananhar (One who knows the secrets of each one’s heart), don’t think that Baba knows everything anyway when you steal something or accept a bribe; no. This is not what Janijananhar means. OK, so what if the Father does know about it when you steal? Those who steal will definitely accumulate one hundred-fold punishment. A lot of punishment will be experienced and their status will be destroyed. The Father says: If you perform such acts, you will have to suffer the consequences. If, after becoming a child of God, you steal, if one of you steals from the bhandara (kitchen) of Shiv Baba from whom you receive such a big inheritance, that is a very big sin. Some people who have the habit of stealing are called jailbirds. This is God’s home; everything here belongs to God. You come to God’s home to receive the inheritance from the Father. Some of you develop that habit and so you accumulate one hundred-fold punishment. A lot of punishment will be experienced. Then, for birth after birth, for many births, you will be born into a dirty home. Therefore, you would have brought that loss on yourself. There are many like that who don’t stay in remembrance at all and who don’t listen to anything either. They only have thoughts of stealing in their intellects. Many such people go to religious gatherings (satsangs) and steal the sandals there. That is their business. Wherever there is a satsang, they go there and steal sandals. This world is very dirty. This is God’s home. The habit of stealing is very bad. It is said: Someone who steals a straw can also steal hundreds of thousands. Ask yourself: How charitable have I become? How much do I remember the Father? How much do I spin the discus of self-realisation? How long do I spend doing God’s service. How many of my sins are being cut away? Look at your chart every day and ask yourself: How much charity did I perform? How long did I stay in yoga? To how many people did I show the path? You may carry on with your business etc. You are karma yogis, and you therefore do have to do things. Baba keeps having these badges made. Explain these to important people. The gates to heaven will open through this Mahabharat War. There is a first-class explanation at the bottom of the picture of Krishna. However, some children have not yet developed such broad and unlimited intellects. They begin to dance as soon as they receive a little money. When someone has a lot of money, he believes that no one else is as wealthy as he is. When children don’t care for the Father, they also don’t care for the imperishable jewels of knowledge that He gives. When Baba tells them to do something, they do something else. Because they are not concerned, they commit a lot of sin. They don’t follow shrimat and then they fall. The Father says: That too is in the drama. It was not in their fortune. Baba knows everything. Many commit sin. When you have the faith that it is the Father who is teaching you, you will have a lot of happiness. You know that you are to become princes and princesses in the future new world. Therefore, there should be so much happiness. However, some children still continue to wilt. Their stage doesn’t remain constant. Baba has explained that rehearsals for destruction will continue to take place. There will also be calamities. All of that will continue to weaken Bharat. The Father Himself says: All of those things have to happen. How else would destruction take place? There will be hailstorms; then what will happen to the farms and fields etc.? Hundreds of thousands of people die, but that is not reported. Therefore, the Father says that the main thing you must check inside yourself is: How much do I remember the Father? Baba, You are so sweet! It is the wonder of You! These are Your orders: Remember Me and you will never become ill for 21 births! Consider yourselves to be souls and remember Me and I guarantee you this. The Father personally tells you and you then relate it to others. The Father says: Remember Me, your Father, and have a lot of love for Me. I show you such an easy path to become pure from impure. Some say: I am a very sinful soul. OK, then don’t commit such sins. Continue to remember Me and your sins of birth after birth will be absolved with this remembrance. The main thing is remembrance. This is called easy remembrance. Remove the word "yoga”. Sannyasis have many different types of hatha yoga. They teach many types of yoga. This Baba had many gurus. The unlimited Father says: Now renounce all of them. I also have to uplift all of them. No one else has the power to say this. The Father has said: I uplift these sages and holy men too. Therefore, how can they be gurus? The Father tells you the one main thing: Ask your heart: Do I commit any sin? Do I cause anyone sorrow? There is no difficulty in this. Check inside you: How much sin did I commit during the whole day? For how long did I stay in remembrance? Only by having remembrance will your sins be absolved. You have to make effort. This is very hard work. Only the one Father gives knowledge. Only the Father shows the path to liberation and liberation-in-life. Achcha.

To the sweetest, beloved, long-lost and now-found children, love, remembrance and good morning from the Mother, the Father, BapDada. The spiritual Father says namaste to the spiritual children.

Essence for dharna:   Have regard for the treasures of the imperishable jewels of knowledge that the Father gives you. Do not become careless and carry out any sinful acts. If you have the faith that God is teaching you, you will stay in limitless happiness.      Never think of stealing something from God’s home. That habit is very dirty. It is said: One who steals a straw can also steal one hundred thousand. Ask yourself: How charitable have I become?

Blessing:

May you be an intense effort-maker who has growth with discipline in your effort and in service.

A Brahmin is someone with a disciplined life. A task is successful when it is done using the right method. In any situation, if there isn’t any growth in your efforts or in service, then something is definitely lacking in the way you do it and so, check: From amrit vela until night, were my thoughts, words, deeds and connections disciplined, that is, was there growth? If there was not, then think what would be the reason for that and find a solution to it and you will not be disheartened. If your life is disciplined there will then definitely be growth and you will become an intense effort-maker.

Slogan:

To be full of cleanliness and honesty is to have real purity.

Sweet children, Baba has come to enable you to earn an imperishable income. You can now earn as many imperishable jewels of knowledge as you want.

Question:

What special effort is required to change devilish sanskars into divine sanskars?

Answer:

 In order to change your sanskars, practise remaining soul conscious as much as possible. Devilish sanskars are created by your coming into body consciousness. The Father has come to change your devilish sanskars into divine sanskars. Make this effort: First, I am a soul, and then there is this body.

Song:

You wasted the night in sleeping and the day in eating. Om shanti. You children have heard this song many times. The spiritual Father continues to warn you spiritual children not to let this time slip by. This is the time for earning a huge income. The Father has come to enable you to earn an income. There is a great deal of income to be earned and you can earn as much as you want. This income is that of filling your aprons with the imperishable jewels of knowledge. This income is for the future. That is the path of devotion and this is knowledge. People do not know that devotion begins when the kingdom of Ravan begins or that knowledge begins when the Father comes to establish the kingdom of Rama. Knowledge is for the new world, whereas devotion is for the old world. The Father says: Now, first of all, consider yourselves to be bodiless (a soul). It is in the intellects of you children that you are first souls and then bodies. However, according to the drama plan, people misunderstand this and think the opposite, that they are first bodies and then souls. The Father says: Those are perishable; you discard one and take another. Sanskars are in the souls. By becoming body conscious your sanskars become devilish. Then the Father has to come in order to change your devilish sanskars into divine ones. This entire creation is that of the one Father, the Creator. Everyone calls Him "Father”, just as a physical father is called father. Both the words "Baba” and "Mama” are very sweet. Only a father is called a creator. First of all, he adopts a wife and then creates a creation. The unlimited Father says: I come and enter this one. His name is glorified. He is called "The Lucky Chariot". They show an image of a human being, not a bull etc. The Lucky Chariot is a human body. Only the Father comes and gives you children His own introduction. You should always say that you are going to BapDada. If you simply say "the Father”, it would then just be the incorporeal One. You can only go to the incorporeal Father when you leave your body. No one can go there just like that. Only the Father gives you this knowledge. Only the Father has this knowledge. This is the treasure store of the imperishable Jewels of Knowledge. The Father is the Ocean of the Jewels of Knowledge. It is not a question of water. It is the treasure store of the jewels of knowledge. He has knowledge. Water cannot be called knowledge. Just as human beings have the knowledge of medicine and of law, in the same way, this too is knowledge. It is about this knowledge of the Creator and of the beginning, middle and end of creation that the rishis and munis say that they do not have knowledge. Only the one Creator can have this knowledge. He is also the Seed of the tree. He has the knowledge of the beginning, middle and end of the world. Only when He comes can He speak this knowledge. You have now received this knowledge, and so you become deities through this knowledge. First you receive knowledge and then you claim the reward. At that time, there is no need for this knowledge. It is not that, because the deities do not have this knowledge, that they are ignorant. No, they attained their status by studying this knowledge. Because people don’t have this knowledge, they call out to the Father: Baba, come and show us the path, that is, give us knowledge about how we can change from impure to pure. You souls now know that you came from the land of peace. Souls reside there in silence. You came here to play your parts. This is the old world, and so the new world must surely have existed. No one knows when it existed or who used to rule there. You have now come to know this from the Father. The Father is the Ocean of Knowledge, the Bestower of Salvation. People call out to Him: Baba, come and remove our sorrow and grant us peace and happiness. Souls knew this but they became tamopradhan. This is why the Father has come once again and is giving His introduction. Human beings neither know about souls nor the Supreme Soul. Souls don’t even have the knowledge to become God conscious. Previously, you too did not have knowledge. Now that you have received knowledge, you understand that you had the faces of human beings and the character of monkeys. The Father has now given you knowledge and so you have become knowledge-full. You have received the knowledge of the Creator and creation. You understand that God is teaching you. Therefore, there should be so much intoxication. Baba is the Ocean of Knowledge and He has unlimited knowledge. Whomever you go to, let alone the knowledge of the beginning, middle and end of the world, they do no even know what a soul is. They also remember the Father as the Remover of Sorrow and the Bestower of Happiness, yet they say that God is omnipresent! The Father says: According to the drama, it’s not their fault. Maya makes their intellects absolutely degraded. Insects only feel happy in the dirt. The Father comes to remove you from the dirt. Human beings are trapped in the bog. They have no knowledge and so what can they do? They are trapped in the quicksand and it is difficult to remove them. Even when you remove them half way or three quarters, they still let go of the hand and fall back in again. While giving knowledge to others, some children become slapped themselves by Maya because they act against the Father’s directions. They try to remove others from the bog and they themselves fall into it. It then takes a great deal of effort to remove them because they are defeated by Maya. The sins they have committed make their consciences bite them inside. It is a battle with Maya. You are now on a battlefield. Those are violent armies that fight with physical power, whereas you are the non-violent army. You claim your kingdom through non-violence. There are two types of violence. One is to use the sword of lust and the other is to beat someone. You are now becoming doubly non-violent. No one knows about this battle of the power of knowledge. No one knows what non-violence is. The paraphernalia of the path of devotion is so huge. People sing: O Purifier come! However, no one knows how I come and purify everyone. In the Gita, they have made the mistake of calling a human being God. Human beings have created the scriptures and it is human beings who read them. Deities do not need to read scriptures. There are no scriptures there. There is knowledge, devotion and then disinterest. Disinterest in what? There is disinterest in devotion and the old world. There is disinterest in the old bodies. The Father says: Whatever you see with your eyes will not remain. There is disinterest in this dirty world. You also have visions of the new world with divine vision. You are studying for the new world. This study is not just for this birth. All other studies are for that time and that particular birth. It is now the confluence age. You receive the reward in the new world for what you are studying now. You receive such a huge reward from the unlimited Father. You attain unlimited happiness from the unlimited Father. Therefore, you children should make full effort and follow shrimat. The Father is the most elevated of all. You become elevated through Him. He is always elevated anyway. He makes you elevated. While taking 84 births, you become degraded. The Father says: I do not come into the cycle of birth and death. I now enter this lucky chariot. You children have recognised him. Your tree is now still small. Storms also come to the tree; leaves continue to fall off. Many flowers emerge. Then, when storms come, they fall off. Some fruits also emerge very well, but even those fall off in the storms of Maya. The storms of Maya are very powerful. On that side, there is physical power, and on this side, there is the power of yoga, the power of remembrance. You have to make the word "remembrance” firm. Those people simply speak of "yoga”. Yours is remembrance. Whilst walking and moving around, continue to remember the Father. This is not called yoga. The word "yoga” is very well known by the sannyasis. They teach many different types of yoga. The Father teaches you so easily: Whilst walking, sitting and moving around, continue to remember the Father. You have been lovers for half the cycle. You have been remembering Me. I have now come. No one understands what a soul is. This is why the Father comes and makes you realise this. This is a very subtle aspect that has to be understood. Souls are extremely subtle and imperishable. Neither a soul nor his part can be destroyed. It is very difficult for those with gross intellects to understand these things. These things are not mentioned in the scriptures. You children have to make a great deal of effort to remember the Father. Knowledge is very easy, but it is said of remembrance that there are those whose intellects have no love for the Father and those whose intellects have love for the Father. When someone’s remembrance is good, it is said that his intellect has love for the Father. Your love has to be unadulterated. Ask yourself: How much do I remember the Father? You also understand that by continuing to have love for the Father, you will all reach your karmateet stage and discard your bodies. Then the war will begin. The more you love the Father, the more satopradhan from tamopradhan you will become. The examination will only take place once. When time comes to an end and all your intellects have love for the Father, destruction will take place. Until then, wars etc. will continue to take place. People from abroad think that death is in front of them and that someone is inspiring them to make bombs. However, what else can they do? It is fixed in the drama. They bring death to their own clan with the power of their own science. You children say: Take us to the pure world. However, Baba would not take your bodies. The Father is the Death of all Deaths. No one else knows these things. It has been remembered: "Death for the prey and happiness for the hunter". They say that destruction should stop and that there should be peace. However, how could peace and happiness be established without destruction taking place? This is why you must definitely explain the cycle. The gates to heaven are now opening. Baba has said: Print a book on this: Gateway to the land of peace and the land of happiness. No one understands the meaning of this. It is so easy, but scarcely a handful out of millions understand. You must not become disheartened at the exhibitions etc. Subjects too are created. The destination is high and it does take effort. Effort is needed for remembrance. Many fail in this. Your remembrance needs to be unadulterated. Maya makes you forget again and again. No one can become a master of the world without making effort. Full effort has to be made. We were the masters of the land of happiness. We have been around the cycle many times. We now have to remember the Father. Maya creates many obstacles. Baba also receives service news of how, today, you explained to an organisation called the Vidhyut Mandali, that today you did this...... Now, according to the drama, the mothers are to be glorified. You children have to be concerned to keep the mothers in front. This is the living Dilwala Temple. You will become the living forms and you will then continue to rule there. Those temples of the path of devotion will not remain. Achcha.

To the sweetest, beloved, long-lost and now-found children, love, remembrance and good morning from the Mother, the Father, BapDada. The spiritual Father says namaste to the spiritual children.

Essence for dharna:   You have to reach your karmateet stage by having unadulterated love for the one Father. Have unlimited disinterest in this old world and old bodies.      Never act against the Father's directionsnor be defeated on the battlefield. Become doubly non-violent.

Blessing:

May you do the service of transforming the atmosphere with your spiritual lightsand easily become an embodiment of success.

In the physical world, whichever colour lighting you use, accordingly the atmosphere becomes like that. If it is green lighting, then there is green light everywhere. When you use the red lighting, it creates an atmosphere of remembrance. Since physical lights are able to transform the atmosphere, then you as a lighthouse, with your lights of purity and happiness, can do the service of transforming the atmosphere and thereby become an embodiment of success. Physical lights are seen with the eyes, whereas spiritual lights will be known with experience.

Slogan:

To waste your time and thoughts in wasteful matters is impurity.

09/05/20     Morning Murli       Om Shanti       BapDada    Madhuban

Sweet children, you souls have love for the one Father. The Father has taught you to have love for souls and not bodies.

Question:

While you are making which effort does Maya create obstacles? What is the way to become a conqueror of Maya?

Answer:

 You make effort to remember the Father so that your sins can be burnt away. Therefore, it is in this remembrance that Maya creates obstacles. The Father, the Master, shows you ways to become a conqueror of Maya. Remember the Master with that recognition and you will remain happy and you will continue to make effort and do a lot of service and you will then become a conqueror of Maya.

Song:

Take us away from this world of sin to a place of rest and comfort. Om shanti. You spiritual children heard the song and understood the meaning of it. No one in the world outside knows its meaning. You children understand that the love of you souls is for the Supreme Father, the Supreme Soul. Souls call out to their Father, the Supreme Father, the Supreme Soul. Is your love for souls or for bodies? The Father now teaches you that love should be for souls. The bodies are to be destroyed. Love is in the souls. Baba explains to you that your love should now be for the Father, the Supreme Soul, and not for bodies. Souls call out to their Father to come and take them to a world of charitable souls. You understand that you were sinful souls and that you are now becoming charitable souls. The Father is making you into charitable souls in a wise way (yukti). It is only when the Father comes Himself and tells you children this that you understand and experience that you are becoming pure, charitable souls by having remembrance of the Father. Your sins are being burnt away with the power of yoga. Sins cannot be washed away by bathing in the Ganges. People go to bathe in the Ganges and rub that mud on their bodies but their sins are not washed away by doing that. Sins can only be removed from the soul with the power of yoga. The alloy is removed. Only you children know and have the faith that your sins will be burnt away by remembering the Father. If you have faith, you should make effort to have remembrance. It is while you are making this effort that Maya creates obstacles. Maya becomes powerful and battles with the powerful ones very well. Why would she battle with weak ones? You children should always be aware that you have to become conquerors of Maya and conquerors of the world. No one understands the real meaning of conquering the world by conquering Maya. It is now being explained to you children how you can gain victory over Maya. Maya too is powerful. You children have found the Master. Hardly anyone knows that Master and that, too, numberwise. Those who know Him have that happiness. They make effort by themselves and also do a lot of service. Many people go to Amarnath. Now, all human beings ask how there can be peace in the world. You now show everyone how there was peace and happiness in the golden age; there was peace over the whole world. At that time, it was the kingdom of Lakshmi and Narayan; there were no other religions then. It was 5000 years before today that the golden age came into existence. The world definitely has to go around the cycle. This is shown very clearly in the pictures. The pictures were also created in the previous cycle. These continue to be improved day by day. Sometimes, children forget to write the dates etc. on the pictures. There should definitely be the dates etc. on the pictures of Lakshmi and Narayan. It is in the intellects of you children that you were residents of heaven and that you are now to become those again. You will claim a status to the extent that you make effort. You are now being made authorities of knowledge by the Father. Devotion is now about to end. There won’t be any devotion in the golden and silver ages. Devotion continues for half the cycle later on. It is only now that you children understand this. After half the cycle, the kingdom of Ravan begins. The whole play is about you people of Bharat. The cycle of 84 births is for Bharat. Previously, you didn't know that Bharat was the imperishable land. Lakshmi and Narayan were called a god and goddess. The status you claim is so elevated and yet this study is so easy! We will complete the cycle of 84 births and then return home. When you speak of the cycle of 84 births, your intellects go upwards. You now remember the incorporeal world, the subtle region and the corporeal world. Previously, you didn’t know what the subtle region was. You now understand how you communicate with one another in the "movie” there. There used to be "movie” films. This makes it easy for you to explain: silence, movie and talkie. Your intellects are now aware of the whole cycle from the kingdom of Lakshmi and Narayan to the present time. While living at home with your families, your only concern should be that you have to become pure. The Father explains: While living at home with your families, finish all attachment to the old world. You have to look after your children etc., but let your intellects be focused on the Father. It is said: While working with your hands, let your intellects be with the Father. While feeding your children and bathing them etc., let there be remembrance of the Father in your intellect because you know that a huge burden of sin has been accumulated. That is why your intellects should go to the Father. Remember that Beloved a great deal. The Father, the Beloved, tells all of you souls: Remember Me! This part is now being enacted again and it will repeat again after 5000 years. The Father shows you such an easy method. There is no other difficulty. Some say that they are not able to do this, that they find it very difficult and that the pilgrimage of remembrance is very difficult. Oh! But, can't you remember the Father? You should not forget the Father. The Father has to be remembered very well because it is only by doing this that your sins can be absolved and you become everhealthy. Otherwise, you won't be able to become this. You are receiving very good, sound advice. This is a medicine that is fully effective too. I guarantee that through this power of yoga you will never have any illness for 21 births. Simply remember the Father! It is such an easy method. On the path of devotion, people remember God out of ignorance. The Father now sits here and explains to you. You understand that you came to Baba in the previous cycle too and that you also made effort then. You now have the firm faith that you used to rule the kingdom and that you then lost it. Now that Baba has come again, you have to claim your fortune of the kingdom from Him again. The Father says: Remember Me and the kingdom! Manmanabhav! Your final thoughts will lead you to your destination. The drama is now coming to an end. We are to return home. Baba has come to take everyone back home just as a bridegroom comes to take his bride home. Brides become very happy that they are going to go to their in-laws' home. All of you are Sitas who belong to the one Rama. Only Rama can release you from Ravan's jail and take you back home. The Liberator is only One and He liberates you from the kingdom of Ravan. Although people do say, "This is the kingdom of Ravan," they don't understand this accurately. This is now being explained to you children. You are being given very good points to explain to others. Baba has told you to write: Peace is being established in the world by the Father as it was in the previous cycle. Establishment is taking place through Brahma. There used to be peace in the world when it was the kingdom of Vishnu. Hardly anyone understands that Vishnu is Lakshmi and Narayan. They consider Vishnu, Lakshmi and Narayan and Radhe and Krishna to be separate. You now understand this. You are the ones who spin the discus of self-realisation. Shiv Baba comes and gives you the knowledge of the world cycle. We are now being made master oceans of knowledge by Him. You are rivers of knowledge. This name is given to you children. People on the path of devotion wander around so much going to bathe. They also perform a lot of charity and give donations. Wealthy ones give a lot in donation. They even donate gold. You now understand how much you used to wander around. You are not hatha yogis; you are Raja Yogis. You used to belong to the pure household path and you then became impure in the kingdom of Ravan. The Father is now establishing the household religion according to the drama. No one else can create this pure path. People ask you: If all of you remain pure, how would the world continue? Tell them: So many sannyasis remain pure, yet the world hasn't stopped, has it? The world population has now grown so much that there isn't enough for people to eat. There's not enough grain, and so what's the point of making the world population grow even more? You children now understand that Baba is present in front of you. However, you cannot see Him with your physical eyes. It is with your intellects that you souls understand that Baba is ever present in front of you and teaches you. Tell those who speak about world peace that the Father is now establishing peace in the world. Destruction of the old world is in front of us because of this. Destruction also took place 5000 years ago. Even now, destruction is in front of everyone. Then, there will be peace in the world. These things are only in the intellects of you children. No one else in the world knows these things. No one else's intellect is aware of these things. You know that there was peace in the whole world in the golden age. At that time, there was no land other than Bharat; all the other lands came later. There are now so many lands. It is now the end of this play. People say that God definitely does exist, but they don’t know who He is or in what form He comes. It cannot be Krishna. No one could make you to do anything through inspiration or his own power. The Father is the most beloved. You receive your inheritance from Him. The Father creates heaven. Therefore, He would surely inspire the destruction of the old world. You know that Lakshmi and Narayan existed in the golden age. They are now becoming that again through their own efforts. There should be this intoxication. They used to rule in Bharat. Shiv Baba gave that kingdom and departed. You wouldn't say that Shiv Baba ruled that kingdom and then departed; no. He departed after giving the people of Bharat that kingdom. Lakshmi and Narayan used to rule that kingdom. Baba has come to give us the kingdom once again. He says: Sweet children, remember Me and spin the cycle. You have taken 84 births. When someone makes less effort, you can understand that he has done less devotion. Those who have done a lot of devotion will make a lot of effort. Baba explains everything so clearly! However, it has to sit in your intellects. Your duty is to make effort. If you have done less devotion, you will not be able to have yoga. Remembrance of Shiv Baba will not stay in your intellects. Never become slack in making effort. When you see how powerful Maya is, don't have heart failure. Many storms of Maya will come. It has also been explained to you children that it is the souls that do everything. The bodies will be destroyed. When a soul leaves his body, the body turns to dust. That body will not be taken again. So, what then is the benefit of remembering it and crying? Would that same body be taken again? That soul has already left and taken another body. You are now earning such a huge income! You are crediting your account, whereas everyone else is debiting their account. Baba is the Innocent Businessman. This is why He gives you palaces for 21 births in return for a handful of rice. He gives so much interest! You can accumulate as much as you want for the future. However, do not think that you can give that to Him at the end. What would He do with it at that time? He is not a foolish businessman. Of what use would it be if He couldn't use it but yet had to give interest for it? He wouldn't take anything from such people. You receive palaces for 21 births in return for a handful of rice. You receive so much interest. Baba says: I am the number one innocent One. I give you the kingdom of the world. Simply belong to Me and do service. It is because He is the Innocent Lord that everyone remembers Him. You are now on the path of knowledge. Now follow the Father's shrimat and claim your kingdom. You tell Baba that you have come to claim your kingdom and, that too, in the sun dynasty. Achcha. May your mouth be sweetened (May it happen practically). Achcha.

To the sweetest, beloved, long-lost and now-found children, love, remembrance and good morning from the Mother, the Father, BapDada. The spiritual Father says namaste to the spiritual children.

Essence for dharna:   Claim the kingdom by following shrimat. Give a handful of rice and claim a palace for 21 births. Accumulate an income for the future.      While living at home with your family, finish all your attachment to the old world and become completely pure. While doing everything, keep your intellect focused on the Father.

Blessing:

May you be truly loving and constantly experience the company of Father Brahma, the one with a thousand arms.

At present, the part of Father Brahma with a thousand arms is being enacted. Just as arms are not able to do anything without the soul, in the same way, the arms, that is, the children, cannot do anything without BapDada. In every task, there is first the Father’s help. While the part of establishment is being played, BapDada is with the children in every thought and at every second. Therefore, do not put up a curtain of separation and be separated in yoga. Move along in the waves of the ocean of love, sing His praise, but do not become hurt. The practical form of love for the Father is to be loving.

The experience and practice of the bodiless stage is the basis for claiming a number ahead.

10/05/20     Madhuban       Avyakt BapDada       Om Shanti    08/01/86    The holy stars of the e arth

Today, the Father, the Sun of Knowledge, is seeing His special stars who are full of many types of speciality. The speciality of each star is such that it gives light for the transformation of the world. Nowadays, people are especially doing research into the stars because of the influence of the stars on the earth. Scientists are trying to research the stars in the sky and BapDada is looking at the specialities of His holy stars. When the stars of the sky are able to exert a good or bad influence over the earth from so far away, then you holy stars can very easily exert your influence to transform the world and create a pure, happy and peaceful world. You are the stars of the earth and those are the stars of the sky. The stars of the earth are those who protect this world from upheaval and make it into a happy and beautiful golden world. At this time, both nature and people are instruments to create upheaval, but you most elevated souls are instruments to enable the world to take a breath of happiness and a breath of peace. You stars of the earth are the stars who are embodiments of all attainments in order to fulfil all desires of all souls. You are the elevated stars of hope who change everyone's feelings of hopelessness into hope. So, check your elevated influence: to what extent do I have the sparkle and splendour of being a star of peace, a holy star, a star that is an embodiment of happiness, a star of constant success, a star that constantly fulfils all desires and a star of contentment? To what extent are you spreading your influence? What is the speed of your influence? Just as you check the speed of those stars, so check yourselves too to see the speed of your own influence, because the world needs you holy stars at present. So, BapDada was seeing all the varieties of stars.

The gathering of you spiritual stars is so elevated and one that gives so much happiness! Do you consider yourselves to be sparkling stars in this way? People are very interested in looking at those stars. The time is now coming when everyone will want to see you holy stars. They will search for you stars and wonder where this influence of peace and happiness and stability is coming from. They will do research into this. At present, they are engrossed in doing research into matter, but when they become tired of doing research into matter, they will have the thought of doing this spiritual research. Before that, you holy stars have to make yourselves complete. Make preparations at a fast speed to fill yourselves with one speciality, whether it is the virtue of peace or power. You also have to research this. You do have all the virtues, but especially make yourself complete by having the speciality of at least one specific virtue. For instance, all doctors have general knowledge of all illnesses. However, along with that, some have special knowledge of a particular form of illness and, because of that speciality, they become well known for that. You have to become full of all virtues, but you especially have to experience one particular speciality, which you can use for service and continue to move forward. For instance, in devotion, in the praise of the goddesses, each one is remembered for her own individual speciality and each one is also worshipped according to that speciality. They especially believe in and worship Saraswati as the goddess of knowledge. She is also an embodiment of power but, because of her speciality, people worship her as the goddess of knowledge. They worship Lakshmi as the goddess of wealth. Similarly, whilst having all virtues and all specialities in yourself, especially do research into one speciality and make yourself influential in that. This year, research every virtue and every power. Go into the depths of every virtue. In its depths, you will be able to experience its greatness. Research deeply the stages of remembrance and the stages of effort. Go into their depths. Have deep experiences. Go to the bottom of the ocean of experiences. Simply to be experienced in moving along in the waves on the surface is not being fully experienced. Become introverted and make your intellect full of the jewels of deep experiences because the time for revelation is coming close. Become full and perfect and the curtain of ignorance that is in front of all souls will then be removed. With your light of perfection, that curtain will automatically open. Therefore, research this. Become a searchlight. Only then can you say that you celebrated the Golden Jubilee.

Let everyone experience this from each one of you as the speciality of the Golden Jubilee. Let them experience the golden powers through your drishti. Just as rays of light give souls power to make them golden, so let your every thought and every action be gold. You are instruments to make them golden. In this year of the Golden Jubilee, consider yourselves to be master lords of divinity, children of the Lord of Divinity (Parasnath, the Divine One who changes a stone into a gem). No matter how much like iron a soul may be, in the company of a divine (paras) one, even iron becomes divine. Do not think: This one is iron. Instead, think: I am divine. It is the duty of a divine one to change iron and make it divine. Always keep this aim and its qualifications in your awareness. Then, the influence of the holy stars will be seen by the world. At present, poor helpless people are afraid that such and such a star is coming. Later, they will become happy that the holy stars are coming. The sparkle of holy stars will be experienced everywhere. It will emerge from everyone's lips that the lucky stars, the stars of success, have come, that the stars of happiness and peace have come. At present, they watch through their binoculars, but at that time they will see with their third eye, their divine eye. However, this is the year for preparation. Prepare yourselves very well. Achcha. What will you do in the programme? BapDada made this scene emerge in the subtle region. What did He see in this scene?

You only seat the speakers on the stage at a conference, do you not? The stage of a conference means a stage of speakers. This is how you arrange it, is it not? You always have lectures on topics, and you do them well, but in this Golden Jubilee let there be a greater impact with less time for lectures. In that time, different speakers can give their powerful lectures. What should be the form of this? On one day, have a half-hour programme especially for this. Let an outside person or a special speaker give a lecture, but for half an hour, let there be those of different ages on the stage that is, one small child, one kumari, one pure couple, one household couple, one elderly person. Let this variety of people sit on the stage in the formation of a half-moon. The stage lights should not be too bright; they should be just right (standard). Let each one speak for three minutes about thespecial golden versions that they have received to make their lives elevated, through which they have created their lives. A young kumar or kumari can also share the golden versions thatchildren have received, what the golden versions are that kumaris have received for a kumari life, whatthegolden versions are that the young celibate couples have received, what golden versions trustee souls living in a household have received and what golden versions the elderly have received. Let each one speak for three minutes. At the end, let the whole audience repeat a slogan in the form of a golden version for everyone. Let there be a spotlight on the person whose turn it is to speak so that everyone's attention automatically goes to that person. Let there be the influence of silence. Let the scene be as though someone is performing a drama. Let it be a lecture but in the form of a scene. They should speak very little, no longer than three minutes. Let preparations be made for this in advance. Next day, let there be the same type of performance by a different wing (profession). For instance, someone may be a doctor, someone a businessman, someone an officer. People from different professions should each speak for three minutes, saying which main golden dharna he uses while performing the duty of an officer to remain successful in his work. Let him relate the main point for success in the form of a golden version. It will be a lecture but, because it will be in a different form, they will see how unlimited this Godly knowledge is and how it is special for each profession. It should not just be that they relate their experience in the form of a three-minute talk but that many others also have an experience. Let the atmosphere be of such silence that those who are listening do not have the courage to create any upheaval or even to say anything. Each Brahmin has to have the aim that, for the duration of the programme, everyone has to maintain the atmosphere like you do when a record is played for traffic control and everyone creates an atmosphere of silence. At that time you maintain silence without words. However, at this time, in order to make the atmosphere powerful, you are not giving lectures of words, but lectures of peace. I too am a speaker and I am tied in this. A lecture of peace is no less. This atmosphere of Brahmins also takes others into that experience. As much as possible, finish all the other activities. All Brahmins definitely have to give their co-operation for making the atmosphere powerful. If someone has a certain duty to fulfil, he should not sit at the front. There shouldn't be any disturbance at the front. Just consider it to be the three hour bhatthi. Then they won't say that it was a good lecture, but that they had a good feeling. Along with the lecture, they should also have that feeling. All the Brahmins that come should come with the understanding that they have to participate in a bhatthi. You mustn't just come to see the conference, but come to give co-operation. So, in this way, create such a powerful atmosphere that, no matter how disturbed those souls are, they are able to experience peace and power for a short time before they go back. They should not feel that there are 3,000 people sitting here, but that it is a gathering of angels. At the time of cultural programmes, they may laugh and be entertained, but at the time of the conference, let there be a powerful atmosphere. Then, others who come will also speak in the same way. Whatever atmosphere is created, other speakers also come under that atmosphere. So, make a programme of giving them many treasures in a short time. Let it be short and sweet. If we Brahmins speak softly, then other people will speak softly too. Achcha. What will you do now? You will reveal yourselves as special stars, will you not? Therefore, celebrate this Golden Jubilee year as the year for making yourselves complete and perfect. Do not come into upheaval and do not bring others into upheaval. Nature itself is enough to create upheaval. Nature is doing its work. You just do yours. Achcha.

To all those who become holy stars and make the world happy and peaceful, to the master lords of divinity who are making the world and everyone in it divine, to those who accumulate the jewels of experiences in themselves by always going to the bottom of the ocean of experiences, to those who become searchlights and remove the curtain of ignorance, to such special stars who reveal the Father, BapDada's love, remembrance and namaste.

BapDada speaking to teachers:

1) You have accepted the contract for making the world new, have you not? Do you always have new zeal and new enthusiasm for making the world new or only on certain occasions? The new world is not established by only sometimes having zeal and enthusiasm. Those who constantly have new zeal and enthusiasm become the instruments to establish the new world. The closer you continue to come to the new world, accordingly, there will continue to be expansion of the special things of the new world. You are the ones who are going to go to the new world and you are the ones who will make the world new. It takes time and energy to create it, but those who are powerful souls will always destroy obstacles and continue to move forward. So you are the foundation of such a new world. What would happen to a building if its foundation is weak? Therefore, those who have the duty of making the world new have to make effort and make a strong foundation. Make it so strong that the building is able to last for 21 births. So, you have prepared your building for 21 births, have you not? Achcha.

2) Do you experience yourselves to be souls who are seated on the Father's heart-throne? At this time you are seated on the heart-throne and you will then be seated on the throne of the kingdom of the world. Only those who have remembrance of the Father merged in their hearts are able to be seated on the heart- throne. Just as the children are always merged in the Father's heart, so let there always also automatically be the remembrance of the Father in the children's heart. What else is there apart from the Father? So maintain the happiness and intoxication that you are seated on the heart-throne. Achcha.

At the time of farewell at 6.00am on the day of the Satguru:

There are always the omens of Jupiter and the Seed of the Tree over all the loving and co-operative children everywhere. You are moving forward with the omens of Jupiter in the service of making others elevated. You are progressing successfully in both service and remembrance and will continue to do so. For the children, the confluence age is the time of Jupiter. Every moment of the confluence age is of Jupiter, that is, it is fortunate. Therefore, you are fortunate, you belong to God, you are those who create fortune and you have a right to the fortunate world. So, love, remembrance and good morning to such constantly fortunate children.

Blessing:

May you be an easy yogi who becomes an example for the world on the basis of following the Godly codes of conduct.

In order to be an example for the world, continue to follow the Godly codes of conduct from amrit vela until night time. Especially know the importance of amrit vela and create a powerful stage at that time and your life will become great throughout the day. When you fill yourself with special power at amrit vela, and move along as an embodiment of power, you will not experience difficulty in any task. By spending your life according to the codes of conduct, you will automatically create the life of an easy yogi. Then, seeing your life, everyone in the world will create their lives.

Slogan:

Give the experience of the greatness of purity through your activity and your face.
