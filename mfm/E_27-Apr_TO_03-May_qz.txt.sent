Sweet children, keep a daily chart of your progress and see what your behaviour was like throughout the day. Check whether you remained honest with the yagya.

Question:

For which children does the Father have a lot of regard? What is the sign of that regard?

Answer:

 The Father has a lot of regard for the children who are honest with the Father, those who are true to the yagya and don't hide anything. Because He has regard for them, He gives them a lot of love and uplifts them. He also sends them on service. You children should have the wisdom to tell the truth and take shrimat.

Song:

The Flame has ignited in the gathering and the moths surrender to the Flame. Om shanti. This song is wrong because you are not moths. In fact, souls cannot be called moths. Devotees have given many different names. Because they don't know, they say: "Neti, neti" (neither this nor that); they are atheists. Nevertheless, they give whatever names enter their minds. They give names such as Brahm, moth, etc. They even say that the Supreme Soul is in the pebbles and stones. Because no one on the path of devotion recognises the Father accurately, the Father has to come Himself and give His own introduction. The Father's introduction is not in the scriptures etc. Therefore, they are called atheists. The Father has now given His introduction to you children. However, it is a great task for the intellect to consider oneself to be a soul and remember the Father. At present, everyone has a stone intellect. An intellect is in each soul. It is understood from a soul's organs (senses) whether that soul's intellect is divine or stone. Everything depends on the soul. People say that each soul is the Supreme Soul and that, because souls are immune to the effect of action, they can do whatever they want. Although they are human beings, they don't know the Father. The Father says: Maya, Ravan, has turned their intellects to stone. Day by day, they are continuing to become more and more tamopradhan. There is a lot of force of Maya and so they don't even reform themselves. You children have been told to write your chart at night of what you did during the whole day. Did I eat food like the deities do? Was my behaviour lawful, or was it like that of a foolish person? If you don't check your chart daily, you will never be able to make progress. Maya continues to slap many children. Some write: Today, my intellect's yoga went to the name and form of so-and-so. Today, I committed this sin. Only a handful out of many write their charts this honestly. The Father says: No one knows Me as I am or what I am at all. Only when you consider yourselves to be souls and remember the Father will something sit in your intellects. The Father says: Although there are many good children who explain knowledge very well, they don't have yoga. Because they don’t have full recognition and are unable to understand, they are unable to explain it to others. People of the whole world don't know the Creator or creation at all. Therefore, they don't know anything. This too is fixed in the drama and it will happen again. In 5000 years time, this age will come again and I will have to come again to explain to you. It is not a small thing to claim a kingdom! It does take a lot of effort. Maya attacks you very much; a great battle takes place. There is boxing. Only those who are very clever engage in boxing. They make one another unconscious. Some say: Baba, there are many storms of Maya and such-and-such happens. There are very few who write the truth; there are many who hide things. They don't understand how to tell Baba the truth or what shrimat they should take. They are unable to speak about it. The Father knows that Maya is very powerful. They are too ashamed to speak the truth. They perform such acts that they are too ashamed to speak about them. The Father gives a lot of regard and uplifts you. This one is very good; I will send this one somewhere for all-round service. That’s it! They become arrogant and experience a slap from Maya and then fall. Of course, Baba praises you in order to uplift you. He gives you a lot of love and uplifts you: You are very good. You are also good at doing physical service. However, He tells you correctly that the destination is very high. The effort of renouncing one’s body and the relationships of one’s body and of considering oneself to be a soul is the work of the intellect. All of you are effort-makers. Such a huge kingdom is being established! All of you are the Father's children, students and followers. That One is the Father of the whole world. Everyone calls out to that One. He comes and continues to explain to you children. In spite of that, there isn't that much regard! When important people come, they are looked after with so much regard. There is so much pomp. At present, everyone is impure but no one considers himself to be impure. Maya has totally degraded their intellects. They say that the duration of the golden age is so many years! Therefore, the Father says: They are 100% senseless. Even though they are humans, just look at what they do! They say of something that is only 5000 years that it is hundreds of thousands of years. The Father comes and explains this: The kingdom of Lakshmi and Narayan existed 5000 years ago. They were human beings with divine virtues. That is why they are called deities. Those with devilish traits are called devils. There is the difference of day and night between deities and devils. There is now so much fighting and violence. All the preparations for war continue to be made. The whole world has to be sacrificed into this sacrificial fire. Therefore, everything is being prepared for this. Such bombs have been invented. They can’t stop manufacturing them now. Within a short time, everyone will have many of them because destruction has to take place very quickly. No hospitals etc. will remain at that time. No one will know anything. It will not be like going to your aunty's home! To have visions of destruction isn't a matter of a few pennies. You’ll be able to see the whole world on fire. You will have visions of how there is just fire everywhere. The whole world has to be destroyed. It is such a huge world! The sky won’t be set on fire; everything under the sky will be destroyed. There is the difference of day and night between the golden age and the iron age. Here, there are so many human beings and animals and things. This too sits in the children's intellects with great difficulty. Just think about it. It is a matter of 5000 years. There used to be the kingdom of deities. There were very few people. Now, there are so many people. It is now the iron age. It will definitely be destroyed. The Father says to you souls: Now, constantly remember Me alone! He has to be remembered with understanding. There are many who simply continue to say, "Shiva, Shiva." Even little children say that, although their intellects have no understanding of Him. They don't say it with the realisation that He is a point of light. We too are such tiny points. You have to remember Him with this understanding. First of all, make this firm: I am a soul. Then, instil the Father's introduction in your intellects very well. Only introverted children can understand this very well: I, the soul, am a point. I, the soul, am now receiving this knowledge of how a part is recorded in me, the soul, for 84 births and how the soul is again becoming satopradhan. Only when you become introverted can you understand these matters. It takes time to do this. You children know that this is your last birth. We are now about to return home. It should be firm in your intellects that each of you is a soul. Only when the awareness of bodies is reduced can your behaviour and words be reformed. Otherwise, because you don't become detached from your bodies, your behaviour becomes even worse. By becoming body conscious you say something or other. There has to be great honesty in the yagya. At the moment you are very careless. You haven't changed your food, drink or atmosphere etc. A lot of time is still needed. Baba remembers the serviceable children. They are the ones who will be able to claim a status. Simply to please yourself about what you do is like chewing roasted chickpeas. You need to be introverted in this. You need tact when you explain to others. No one understands at the exhibitions. They simply say that what you say is right. Here, too, it is numberwise. You have the faith that you have become the Father's children and that you receive the inheritance of heaven from the Father. Your only business is to continue to do the Father's service fully. Then, you would be churning the ocean of knowledge throughout the day. This Baba must also be churning the ocean of knowledge. How else could he claim a status? Both together continue to explain to you children. Because it is a steep climb, you have been given two engines. When a train is climbing a mountain, it has two engines. Sometimes, the train stops moving forward and even slips back. It is the same with My children. Whilst climbing and making effort, they stop; they are unable to climb any more. They experience an eclipse or storm of Maya. Then, they totally fall and break into pieces. When some do just a little service they become arrogant and fall. They don't understand that Dharamraj is with the Father. If they perform any such acts, great punishment has to be experienced. It is better that they go and live outside. To belong to the Father and claim your inheritance is not like going to your aunty's home! If, after belonging to the Father, you perform such acts, you defame His name. You would then be hurt very badly. To become an heir is not like going to your aunty's home! Some of the subjects become so wealthy, don't even ask! On the path of ignorance too, some are good, and some are not so good. Parents tell their unworthy children not even to stand in front of them. Here, it is not just a question of one or two children. Here, Maya is very powerful. Therefore, you children have to become very introverted. Only then will you be able to explain to anyone. They will then be ready to sacrifice themselves to you. They will repent a great deal because they have been insulting the Father so much. The punishment for someone who calls God omnipresent or who says that he himself is God is not small. They cannot return just like that! For them it is even more of a problem. When the time comes, the Father will ask for their accounts. At the time of judgement, everyone's accounts have to be settled. A very broad, unlimited intellect is needed to understand this. Just look at people; they give peace prizes to all sorts! In fact, there is only the One who can bring about peace. You children have to write: Purity, peace and prosperity are being established in the world according to God's shrimat. Shrimat is very well known. People give so much regard to the scripture Shrimad Bhagawad Gita. When someone does something to another one’s scripture or temple, fighting breaks out. You now know that this whole world will burn and be destroyed. Those temples, mosques etc. will continue to be burnt. However, before all of that happens, you have to become pure! You should have this concern. You also have to look after your household. Many people come here; you can't all just live here like goats. Because this life is an invaluable life, it has to be looked after very well. Bringing young children here will have to be stopped. How can someone here sit and also look after all your children? When children have holidays, some think: Where else can we go? Let's go to Baba in Madhuban. This then becomes like a dharamshala (rest place for pilgrims). So, how could it be a university? Baba observes this now and He will issue an order at some point that no one will be allowed to bring children here. That bondage will also be lessened. There is a feeling of mercy for the mothers. You children know that Shiv Baba is incognito. Some have no regard for this one. They believe that they have a connection with Shiv Baba. They don't even understand that Shiv Baba has to explain through this one. Maya catches hold of some by their nose and makes them perform wrong acts. She doesn't let go. In a kingdom, all are needed. You will have all these visions at the end. You will also have visions of punishment. Even though some children also had these visions before, they don't stop committing sin. It's as though some children have tied a knot to become thirdclass. Therefore, they don't stop committing sin. In fact, they are making very good preparations for their own punishment. It has to be explained to them: Do not tie a knot of having to become thirdclass. Now tie a knot for becoming Lakshmi or Narayan. Some tie a knot very well and also write up their chart daily: Did I do anything wrong today? Many used to write such charts. However, they are no longer here. Maya made them fall right down. I give you happiness for half a cycle and Maya causes you sorrow for half a cycle. Achcha.

To the sweetest, beloved, long-lost and now-found children, love, remembrance and good morning from the Mother, the Father, BapDada. The spiritual Father says namaste to the spiritual children.

Essence for dharna:   Become introverted and practise staying beyond the consciousness of your body. Reform your food, drink, activity and behaviour. Don’t simply be happy with what you do and become careless.      This climb is very steep. Therefore, be very cautious as you move along. Carry out every act with great caution. Do not become arrogant. Do not prepare your own punishment by doing wrong things. Tie a knot for definitely becoming like Lakshmi and Narayan.

Blessing:

May you be a complete destroyer of attachment and finish any pull from situations in the form of suffering of karma.

Until now, circumstances created by matter pull your stage to themselves to some extent. The greatest pull is the karmic account of the body and the situations that come in the form of the remaining karma suffering; these pull you. When this pull finishes you will be said to be a complete destroyer of attachment. No situation of the body or physical world will be able to make your stage fluctuate. This is the stage of perfection. When you reach such a stage you will then easily be able to stabilise your form as a master almighty authority in a second.

Slogan:

The vow of purity is the vow of the most elevated true Narayan. Supersensuous joy is merged in this.

Sweet children, now that the play is coming to an end you will have to return home. Therefore, finish all your attachment to this world. Remember your home and the new kingdom.

Question:

When is a donation important? Which children receive the return of such a donation?

Answer:

 A donation is important when you have no attachment to that which you donate. If you make a donation and then remember whatever you have given, you cannot receive any return for that. Donations are made for a return in the next birth. Therefore, finish all attachment to whatever you have in this birth. Look after everything as a trustee. Whatever you use for God’s service here, however many hospitals and colleges you open through which many will benefit, you will receive the return of that for 21 births. Om shanti. Do you children remember your home and your kingdom? Whilst sitting here, do not think about your physical home or business etc. Only your home has to be remembered. We are now about to leave this old world and return to the new world. This old world is to be destroyed. Everything will be sacrificed into this sacrificial fire. Whatever you see with your physical eyes, your friends and relatives etc., are all to be destroyed. The Father sits here and explains this knowledge to you spirits. Children, you now have to return home; the play is now coming to an end. This cycle is of 5000 years. The world cycle exists eternally, but it takes 5000 years to rotate. All the souls living here will return home. This old world is to be destroyed. Baba explains every aspect very clearly. Some are misers and waste their property for nothing. On the path of devotion, people give donations and perform charity. Some build dharamshalas (rest places for pilgrims), some build hospitals etc. Their intellects understand that they will receive the fruit of that in their next birth. No one does anything without hoping for some sort of return, without being free from desire. Many say that they have no desire for a reward for what they do, but they definitely do receive the fruit of whatever they do. For instance, when someone uses some of his money to make a donation, it will remain in his intellect that he will receive the return of that in his next birth. Here, if you have attachment to what you give, if you think that that thing was yours, you can’t receive the fruit of it in the next birth. Donations are given to receive a return in the next birth. Since you receive the return in your next birth, why should you have any attachment to it in this birth? Therefore, in order for all your attachment to end, you are made trustees. When someone takes birth in a good, wealthy family, it is said that he must have performed good deeds in his previous birth. Someone takes birth to a king and queen because he gave donations and performed charity. However, that is a matter of a temporary period, of just one birth. You are now studying an education here. You know what you have to become through this study. Therefore, imbibe divine virtues. A spiritual university and hospital is opened with the donations you give here. Once you have given something in donation, all your attachment to it must end, because you know that you are to receive the return of that from the Father for the future 21 births. All of these buildings etc. that the Father has had built are only for a temporary period. Otherwise, where would all these children live? Everyone gives everything to Shiv Baba. He is the Lord and Master. He then does everything through this one. Shiv Baba doesn’t rule. He, Himself, is the Bestower. What would He have attachment to? The Father now gives shrimat; He says: Death is standing in front of you. Previously, when you used to donate something to someone, there was no question of death. Now that Baba has come, the old world is to be destroyed. Baba says: I have come to finish this impure world. The entire old world is to be sacrificed into this sacrificial fire of Rudra. Whatever future you make for yourself, you will receive that in the new world. Otherwise, everything will be finished here; someone or other will eat it up. Nowadays, people still give credit. When destruction takes place, everything will be destroyed. No one will be able to give back anything to anyone; everything will be left behind. Today, everything may be good; tomorrow, there will be bankruptcy, no one will get their money back. If you give something to someone and he dies, who would return that to you? So, what should you do? Use it to benefit Bharat for 21 births; use it to benefit yourself too for 21 births. Whatever you do, you do for yourself. You know that, by following shrimat, you are claiming a high status through which you are to receive happiness and peace for 21 births. This is called the spiritual hospital and university of the eternal Father through which you receive health, wealth and happiness. Some have health but not wealth, and so there cannot be happiness. If you have both, you can remain happy. The Father gives you both for 21 births. You have to accumulate enough of these for 21 births. It is the task of the children to create ways to do this. The fortune of the poor children opens when the Father comes. The Father is the Lord of the Poor. These things are not in the fortune of the wealthy. At present, Bharat is the poorest land. It used to be the richest land and it has now become the poorest. At present, all souls are impure. There can't be a single impure soul where there are pure souls. That is the golden age which is satopradhan, and this is the iron age which is tamopradhan. You are now making effort to become satopradhan. The Father is reminding you children of this. Therefore, you understand that you truly were residents of heaven, that you took 84 births. To speak of 8.4 million different species is just a lie. Did you live as animal species for so many births, and is this, your last birth, human? Do you now have to return to the animal species? The Father explains: Death is now standing in front of you. There aren't 40,000 to 50,000 years left. People are in extreme darkness. This is why they are called those with stone intellects. Your intellects are now being changed from stone to divine. Sannyasis etc. cannot explain these things to you. The Father is now reminding you that you have to return home; therefore, transfer your bags and baggage as much as possible. Baba, take all of this and I will receive everything in the golden age for 21 births. This Baba also used to give donations and perform charity. He had a lot of interest in doing that. Businessmen usually put aside two paisa for charity, whereas Baba used to put aside one anna (twice as much). "No one who comes to your door should leave empty handed.” No one knows that God has come in person. People die while giving donations and performing charity, and so where would they receive the return of that? They do not become pure. They do not have love for the Father. The Father has explained: The intellects of the Yadavas and the Kauravas have no love for the Father at the time of destruction, whereas the intellects of the Pandavas are full of love for the Father at the time of destruction. The people of Europe are all Yadavas because they create bombs etc. Just look at what has been written in the scriptures! According to the dramaplan many scriptures have been created. There is no question of inspiration here. Inspiration means ideas. The Father does not teach through inspiration. The Father explains: This one was a businessman. He had a good reputation and was held in high regard by everyone. When the Father entered him he started to be insulted. They do not know Shiv Baba, so they can’t insult Him. It is this one who has to take all the insults. Krishna denied eating the butter. This one also says: All of this is Baba’s work. I don't do anything. He is the Magician, I am not that. People insult this one for no reason. Did I abduct anyone? I didn't tell anyone to run away from home and come here. I was simply living there. They themselves came running. He is blamed without reason. He received so many insults! Just look at what has been written in the scriptures! The Father explains: This will also happen again. All of these things are matters of knowledge. No human being can do this. At that time, it was the kingdom of the British Government. So many mothers and daughters came and stayed. No one could do anything about it. When the relatives of some came, they would try to take them back. Baba would tell them: You can try and make her understand and take her back; I do not forbid anyone to leave. However, no one had the courage. It was the Father's power. It was nothing new. All of that will happen again. This one had to take the insults. This is the story of Draupadi. All of you are Draupadis and they are all Dushasans. It is not a question of just one. Who wrote all of those lies in the scriptures? The Father says: That too is part of the drama. No one has knowledge of souls. Everyone has become totally body conscious. A lot of effort is needed to become soul conscious. Ravan has turned you completely upside-down. The Father is now turning you the right way up. When you become soul conscious, you automatically have the awareness of being souls and that those are your harmoniums for you to play. When you maintain this awareness, you are also able to imbibe divine virtues. You must not cause anyone sorrow. There used to be the kingdom of Lakshmi and Narayan in Bharat. It is a matter of 5000 years. Those who say that it is hundreds of thousands of years are in total darkness. According to the drama, time has now come to an end and so the Father has once again come. The Father says: Now follow My shrimat! Death is standing in front of you. Otherwise, the desires that are within you will remain unfulfilled. Everyone definitely has to die. This is the same Mahabharat War. The more you benefit yourself, the better it is. Otherwise, you will return empty handed. Everyone else in the world has to return empty handed. Only you children go back with your hands full, which means you return wealthy. A totally unlimited and broad intellect is needed to understand this. There are people of many religions. Each one's act is different. No two persons' acts can be identical. Each one's features are his own. There are so many different features. All of this is fixed in the drama. These are wonderful aspects. The Father says: Now consider yourselves to be souls. I, the soul, go around the cycle of 84 births. I, the soul, am an actor in this drama. I cannot leave it. No one can attain eternal liberation. Therefore, it is useless even to try. The Father says: It is impossible for anyone to leave the drama and impossible for anyone to be added to it. So much knowledge cannot remain in everyone's intellect. Churn the knowledge in this way throughout the whole day. Have remembrance for one moment, two moments and continue to increase it. By all means, do eight hours physical service. Have a rest, but also make time to serve this spiritual Government. The main thing is that you serve yourself. Stay on the pilgrimage of remembrance, and also attain a high status with knowledge. Keep an accurate chart of your remembrance. Knowledge is easy. Just as it is in the Father's intellect that He is the Seed of the human world and that He knows the beginning, the middle and end of that, in the same way, our intellects know that we are Baba's children. Baba has explained how this cycle continues to turn. You also give eight to ten hours to your business. If a good customer comes at night, you never yawn. Here, too, when someone yawns, it is understood that that person is tired, that his intellect must be wandering elsewhere. Those living at the centres also have to remain very cautious. The children who don’t worry themselves about others but are only concerned with their own studies constantly make progress. Do not have waste thoughts about others and thereby destroy your own status. Hear no evil! See no evil! If things someone says are not good, listen with one ear and let it out of the other. Always look at yourself, not others. Do not stop studying! There are many who sulk and stop coming. Later, they come back. Where would they go if they didn't come here? There is only one school. Don’t put an axe to your own feet! Simply remain engrossed in your study. Stay very happy. God is teaching you, and so what more do you want? God is our Father, Teacher and Satguru. Therefore, your intellects have to be connected in yoga to only Him. He is the number one Beloved of the whole world and He is making you the number one masters of the world. The Father says: You souls are very impure and so you can’t fly. Your wings have been clipped. Ravan has clipped the wings of all souls. Shiv Baba says: No one, except Me, can make you pure. All the actors have to come here and the population has to continue to grow. No one can return home yet. Achcha.

To the sweetest, beloved, long-lost and now-found children, love, remembrance and good morning from the Mother, the Father, BapDada. The spiritual Father says namaste to the spiritual children.

Essence for dharna:   Remain busy with thoughts of your eternal self and the study. Do not look at others. If someone does not say good things, listen with one ear and let it out of the other. Don't sulk or stop studying.      Donate everything while alive and finish all your attachment. Will everything, become a trustee and remain light. Become soul conscious and imbibe all divine virtues.

Blessing:

May you become an embodiment of an example by transforming your main sanskar and thereby transform the world.

Each one has one main sanskar, which you call nature, and from time to time it becomes an obstruction to you moving forward. Become those who transform that main sanskar and become embodiments of an example for only then will the whole world be transformed. Now, bring about such transformation that no one can say, "This has been one’s sanskar from the beginning.” When the old sanskar is not visible to any percentage and not even a single trace of it is visible, when it is not spoken about, you would then be said to be an embodiment of an example of complete transformation.

Slogan:

Time for trying has now passed, so make a promise from your heart and transform your life.

Sweet children, this Brahmin clan of yours is unique. Only you Brahmins are knowledge-full. You now know about gyan (knowledge), vigyan (beyond knowledge or yoga) and agyan (ignorance).

Question:

What easy effort should you children make in order for your hearts to move away from everything else?

Answer:

 Simply engage yourselves in spiritual business. The more spiritual service you do, the more your hearts will automatically move away from everything else and you will become busy making effort to claim the kingdom. However, as well as doing this spiritual service, you also have to look after your creation that you have created.

Song:

The rain of knowledge is for those who are with the Beloved. Om shanti. It is the Father who is called the Beloved. You children are now sitting in front of the Father. You children know that you are not sitting in front of a sannyasi or sage. That Father is the Ocean of Knowledge. It is through knowledge that there is salvation. People speak of gyan, vigyan and agyan. Vigyan means to become soul conscious and to stay on the pilgrimage of remembrance. Gyan is the knowledge of how the world cycle continues to turn. People do not know the real meaning of gyan, vigyan or agyan at all. You are now confluence-aged Brahmins. This Brahmin clan of yours is unique. No one knows it. It doesn’t say in the scriptures that Brahmins exist at the confluence age. They know that Prajapita Brahma existed in the past, which is why he is also called Adi Dev (the First Deity). Who then is Adi Devi Jagadamba (World Mother)? No one in the world knows this. She must definitely be a mouth-born creation of Brahma. Jagadamba is not Brahma's wife; she is adopted. You children are also adopted. Brahmins cannot be called deities. There is a temple to Brahma here. He too is a human being. Saraswati is with Brahma. Then, there are also temples to the goddesses. All of them are human beings of this time. They have created a temple to only one. Since there is Prajapita (Father of People), there must be many people. They are now being created. The clan of Prajapita Brahma is now increasing. You children are adopted; the unlimited Father has now adopted you. Brahma too is a child of the unlimited Father. He too receives his inheritance from that One. You are grandsons and granddaughters who receive the inheritance from that One. No one has this knowledge because only the one Father is the Ocean of Knowledge. Until that Father comes, no one can attain salvation. You have now left devotion and come into knowledge in order to attain salvation. The golden age is called salvation and the iron age is called degradation because it is the kingdom of Ravan. Salvation is the kingdom of Rama; it is also called the sun dynasty. The accurate names are the sun dynasty and the moon dynasty. You children know that you first belonged to the sun-dynasty clan and that you took 84 births. This knowledge cannot be in any of the scriptures because the scriptures belong to the path of devotion. All of that is to be destroyed. Those people will take the sanskars that they have and start creating those things there. You are being filled with the sanskars of ruling. You will rule there and those scientists will use the skills they have in that kingdom. They will definitely go into the sun and moon dynasties. They simply have the knowledge of science and they will take the sanskars of that; those are also sanskars. They are also making effort; they have that knowledge. You do not have any other knowledge. You are claiming the kingdom from the Father. Those in business, too, still have those sanskars. There is so much conflict. However, until you reach the stage of retirement, you have to take care of your households, otherwise, who else would look after your children? They cannot come and stay here. You are told that when you become busy in this business, you can then be freed from all of that. However, together with this business, you also have to look after your creation. Yes, the hearts of those who become very busy in doing spiritual service then move away from other things. They will think, "The more time I give to this spiritual service, the better it will be." The Father has come to show you the way to change from impure to pure. Therefore, you children have to do this service. Each one's accounts are looked at. The unlimited Father simply gives directions for you to change from impure to pure. He only shows the way to become pure, but this one’s business is to look after everything else and give advice etc. Shiv Baba says: Don’t ask Me for advice about your business etc. You called out to Me to come and purify you, and I am doing that through this one. He too is your father and you have to follow his directions. That One's directions are spiritual and this one's are physical. This one also has so much responsibility! He also continues to say: Baba's directions are to remember Him constantly. Follow the Father's directions! However, if you children want to ask about how to carry on in your work, physical Baba can explain such things to you very well. He is experienced and can tell you everything about the way he does things. You have to learn by watching him. He will continue to teach you because he is ahead of everyone. All the storms first come to him. This is why he is the most powerful of all and why he therefore claims the highest status. Maya too is powerful and battles with you. This one instantly renounced everything. That was in his part. Baba made him do that. That One is Karankaravanhar, is He not? He renounced everything in happiness. He had a vision that he was to become the master of the world; therefore, what would he do with those things worth only a few pennies? He was also given a vision of destruction, through which he understood that this old world was to be destroyed. He understood that he was going to receive the kingdom once again, and so he instantly renounced all of that business. I now have to follow the Father's directions. The Father says: Remember Me! According to the drama, this bhatthi had to be created. People didn’t understand why all of you came running. This one is not a sage or a holy man; he is a simple person. He didn’t abduct anyone. There are no divine activities of Krishna. The praise doesn’t belong to a human being. The praise only belongs to the one Father; that's all! Only the Father comes and grants everyone happiness. It is He who speaks to you. Whom have you come to? Your intellects go up there and also here because you know that Shiv Baba is the Resident of that place. He has now entered this one’s body. We receive the inheritance of heaven from the Father. Heaven will definitely come after the iron age. Krishna too receives the inheritance from the Father and goes and rules there. There is no question of divine activities in that. It's just like a prince being born to a king. He studies at school and then receives the throne when he grows up. There is no question of praise or divine activity in that. Only the one Father is the Highest on High. The praise also belongs to Him alone. This one gives His introduction. If I (Brahma) were to say that I am sayingthis, people would think that I am referring to myself. Only you children understand that no human being can be called God. Only the incorporeal One is God. He lives in the supreme abode. Your intellects go up above and come down here. Baba comes from the faraway land into this foreign land; He teaches us and then returns home. He Himself says: I come in a second; it doesn't take long. Souls too leave their bodies and enter others in a second. No one can see this. Souls are very fast. "Liberation in life in a second” is remembered. The kingdom of Ravan is called the land of bondage where it is a life of bondage. When a son is born he receives his father's inheritance. You have recognized the Father and are becoming the masters of the world. However, you receive a status, numberwise, according to the efforts you make. The Father continues to explain very clearly. There are two fathers: the one of this world and the One from beyond this world. People sing, "Everyone remembers God at the time of sorrow but no one remembers Him at the time of happiness.” You people of Bharat know that when you lived in happiness you didn’t remember Him. Whilst taking your 84 births, alloy was mixed into you souls and so your degrees reduced: from being 16 celestial degrees completely pure you lost two degrees. Because Rama passed with fewer marks, he has been portrayed with a bow and arrow. However, he didn't break a bow. They have just shown a symbol. All of those aspects belong to the path of devotion. People wander about so much in devotion! You have now received knowledge. Therefore, your wandering has ended. To say "O Shiv Baba!" means to call out. You mustn’t say such words. You must remember the Father. If you cry out, it means you have a trace of devotion. To say, "O God!" is also a devotional habit. Baba hasn’t told you to remember Him by saying, "O God!" He says: Become introverted and remember Me. You must not continue to chant. The word "chanting” also belongs to the path of devotion. You have received the Father's introduction. Now follow the Father's shrimat! Remember the Father in the same way as a physical child remembers his physical father. He himself is body conscious and he remembers his bodily father. The Father from beyond is soul conscious. Even when He enters this one He doesn't become body conscious. He says: I take this body on loan. I have taken this body on loan in order to give you knowledge. I am the Ocean of Knowledge, but how can I give you knowledge? You enter a womb. I do not enter a womb. My ways and means are unique. No one knows that the Father enters this one. It is said: "Establishment through Brahma", but how is establishment carried out through Brahma? Would He give him inspiration? The Father says: I enter an ordinary body and name him Brahma because he renounces everything. You children know that the rosary of Brahmins cannot be created at this time, because they (Brahmins) continue to break. When you Brahmins are finally ready, the rosary of Rudra is created. You then go into the rosary of Vishnu. In order to go into that rosary, you need the pilgrimage of remembrance. It is now in your intellects that you were at first satopradhan and that you then went through the stages of sato, rajo and tamo. You understand the meaning of "Hum so, so hum". The meaning of "Om” is different from that. "Om” means, "I, the soul”. That soul then says: I was a deity who became a warrior, etc. However, those people (sannyasis) then say: I, the soul, am the Supreme Soul. The meanings of "Om" and "Hum so" are completely different. I am a soul and this soul goes through the different clans. I, the soul, first become a deity, and then a warrior etc. It isn't that a soul is the Supreme Soul. It is because they don’t have full knowledge that they have confused the meanings. They say: I am the brahm element. That too is wrong. The Father says: I do not become the Master of creation. You are the masters of this creation. You become the masters of the world. Brahm is just the element of light. You souls become the masters of this creation. The Father now sits here and gives you the accurate meaning of the Vedas and scriptures. Now continue to study! The Father continues to explain new things to you. What does devotion say and what does knowledge say? On the path of devotion, you built temples, did penance and tapasya and wasted your money. Many looted your temples. That too is part of the drama; you will receive everything back from them. Just look how much they are giving you now! Day by day, they continue to increase the amount and you (Bharat) continue to take it. They will return exactly what they took. They cannot digest the wealth they took from you. The land of Bharat is imperishable. It is the Father's birthplace. The Father only comes here. They take it from the Father's land; therefore, they have to return it. Just look how you are being given this back at the time of need. You know about these things. They do not know when destruction will take place. The Government doesn’t believe these things either. This is fixed in the drama. They continue to incur debt. Everything is now being returned. You know that they took a lot of wealth from your kingdom and that they are now returning it. You do not have to be concerned about that. Just have the one concern of remembering the Father. Only by having this remembrance will your sins be absolved. Knowledge is very easy. Now, it all depends on how much effort each one of you makes. You will continue to receive shrimat. You have to take directions from the eternal Surgeon in every respect. Achcha.

To the sweetest, beloved, long-lost and now-found children, love, remembrance and good morning from the Mother, the Father, BapDada. The spiritual Father says namaste to the spiritual children.

Essence for dharna:   Whatever time you have, use that time in doing spiritual business. Imbibe the sanskars of doing spiritual business. Do the service of purifying the impure.      Become introverted and remember the Father. Do not use the term "O God!" Just as the Father has no ego, you too have to become egoless.

Blessing:

May you be ever-ready and beat the drums of victory by collectively practising having a constant and stable stage.

The drums of victory in the world will beat when everyone’s thoughts are merged in one thought. When everyone becomes collectively stable in one stage you will then be said to be ever-ready. To follow one direction in a second, to have a constant and stable stage and to be stable in one thought – the sign of all of this is one finger, the finger with which the iron-aged mountain is lifted. Therefore, practise creating a constant and stable stage collectively for only then will the name of the Shakti Army be glorified in the world.

To feel tiredness from making elevated effort is a sign of laziness.

Sweet children, the Father's shrimat makes you constantly happy. Therefore, renounce the directions of bodily beings and only follow the elevated directions of the one Father.

Question:

Which children's intellects have not yet stopped wandering?

Answer:

 The intellects of those who don't have faith in the directions of the highest-on-high Father, that is, in God’s directions, have not yet stopped wandering. Because of not having full faith in the Father, they keep a foot on each side. As well as following the Father's directions, they also continue to perform devotion and bathe in the Ganges etc. What will become the state of such children? It is because they do not follow shrimat completely that they continue to stumble.

Song:

Take us away from this land of sin to a world of rest and comfort. Om shanti. You children heard this song of the devotees. You no longer sing this. You know that you have found the highest-on-high Father. He alone is the Highest on High. All human beings are at present in their most degraded stage. The highest-on-high human beings were those deities in Bharat. Their praise is of being full of all virtues etc. People don't know who made those deities so elevated. They have now become totally impure. The Father is the Highest on High. Sages and holy men etc. all pray to Him. Human beings have been wandering after such sages for half a cycle. You know that the Father has now come. We now go back to the Father. By giving us His shrimat, He makes us most elevated and constantly happy. It was by following the directions of Ravan that you became those with the most degraded intellects. You must now no longer follow anyone else's directions. You have called out to Me, the Purifier Father. So, why do you chase after those who drown you? Why do you renounce the directions of the One and continue to stumble along after many others? Many children listen to this knowledge and then also go and bathe in the Ganges or go to gurus etc. The Father says: That Ganges is not the Purifier. In spite of that, if you follow human dictates and go and bathe there, then the Father would say: You do not have faith in the directions of the highest-on-high Father! On the one side, there are God's directions, and on the other side, there are devilish directions. What would become of such people? If you keep a foot in each boat you would be torn apart. They do not have full faith in the Father. They say: Baba, I belong to You and will become elevated by following Your shrimat. Every step we take has to be according to the directions of the highest-on-high Father. Only the Father will make you into the masters of the land of silence and the land of happiness. Therefore, the Father says: The one whose body I have entered had 12 gurus but he still became tamopradhan. There wasn't any benefit in following them. When he found the Father, he renounced them all. When he found the highest-on-high Father, the Father said: Hear no evil! See no evil! Human beings are now totally impure and have tamopradhan intellects. There are also many here who are unable to follow shrimat; they don't have enough strength. Maya continues to make them stumble. Ravan is the enemy, whereas Rama is your Friend. Some call Him Rama and some call Him Shiva. His real name is Shiv Baba. I do not take rebirth. According to the drama, My name is Shiva. People have become confused because ten different names have been given to the One. They gave whatever names entered their minds. My real name is Shiva. I enter this body, I do not enter Krishna etc. People think that Vishnu resides in the subtle region. In fact, he is the dual-form that represents the family path. However, there isn't anyone with four arms. Four arms symbolise family life, whereas two arms symbolise the path of isolation. The Father establishes the religion of the family path. Sannyasis belong to the path of isolation. Those who belong to the family path become impure from pure. Therefore, in order to support the world, it is in the parts of sannyasis to become pure. There are hundreds of thousands and millions of them. When a mela takes place many go there. They do not prepare their own food; they live on the sustenance they receive from householders. They have renounced performing action, so where would they get their food from? So, they eat what householders give them. Householders believe that those are their donations. This one too was an impure worshipper. He is now becoming pure by following shrimat. He is making effort to claim his inheritance from the Father. This is why you are told to follow the father. Maya makes you fall in every respect. It is because of body consciousness that people make mistakes, whether they are poor or wealthy. You should at least make effort to break body consciousness! For the body consciousness to break is great effort. The Father says: Consider yourselves to be souls and play your parts through your bodies. Why do you become body conscious? According to the drama, you had to become body conscious. At this time you have become completely body conscious. The Father says: You are souls. It is the soul that does everything. When a soul leaves his body, if that body were then cut, would there be any sound? No. It is the soul that says: Do not hurt my body. Souls are imperishable, whereas bodies are perishable. Consider yourselves to be souls and remember Me, the Father. Renounce body consciousness. To the extent that you children become soul conscious, accordingly you will continue to become healthy and free from disease. With this power of yoga you become free from disease for 21 births. The more soul conscious you become, the higher the status you will claim. You will also be liberated from punishment; otherwise, there will have to be a great deal of punishment. Therefore, you have to become very soul conscious. Many do not have the fortune of receiving this knowledge. How could someone become a deity unless he came into your clan, unless he became a Brahmin, that is, a mouth-born child of Brahma? Many come here and they then write, saying "Baba, Baba" just for the sake of saying it. They just write one or two letters and then disappear. They too will go to heaven, but amongst the subjects. Many subjects are created. Later on, when there is a lot of sorrow, many will come running. Many centres will open and the sound will spread that God has come. You children still lack becoming soul conscious. There is still a great deal of body consciousness. If, at the end, there is any body consciousness in you, your status too will be reduced. You will then become maids and servants. There are many maids and servants, numberwise. The kings are given maids in the dowry. The wealthy subjects are not given them. Some children have seen (in visions) how many maids and servants Radhe brought with her in her dowry. As you progress you will have many visions. It is better to be a wealthy subject than an ordinary maid. The word "maid" is bad; it is still better to become a wealthy subject. When you belong to the Father, Maya offers you greater hospitality. She becomes more powerful and fights with those who are powerful. Then, because of body consciousness, you turn your faces away from Shiv Baba; you stop remembering Baba. You have time to eat, and yet you don't have time to remember the Father who makes you into the masters of the world! Many good children forget Shiv Baba and become body conscious. Should you not even remember the Father and write a letter to the One who has given you the donation of life? However, don't even ask! Maya catches hold of you by the nose and leads you away. By following shrimat at every step, you receive an income of multimillions at every step. You become wealthy to such an extent that your wealth is uncountable. You receive wealth, prosperity, land, everything. Copper, iron, bronze etc. do not exist there. There are only gold coins there. Even the buildings are made of gold. So, what would you lack? This is the corrupt kingdom. As are the rulers, so are the subjects. In the golden age, as are the rulers, so the subjects: all are elevated. However, this doesn't sit in the intellects of human beings; they are tamopradhan. The Father explains: You used to be like that. This one was also like that. I have now come to make you into deities. Even then, you do not become that. You continue to fight among yourselves. "I am very good. I am this. I am that." None of them understands that they are in hell. We are in the extreme depths of hell. You children know this, numberwise, according to the effort you make. Human beings are now in extreme hell. They live in worry day and night. On the path of knowledge, those who do not serve to make others like themselves but worry about "mine and yours" are the ones who are ill and diseased. To remember anyone but the Father is adulterated remembrance. The Father says: Do not listen to anyone else! Listen to Me alone! Remember Me alone! There is no benefit in remembering human beings. It is better to remember deities. The Father asks: Why do you bow your heads? When you are coming to this Baba, remember Shiv Baba and then come here. When you do not remember Shiv Baba, it is as though you are committing sin. Baba says: First of all, make a promise to become pure. Remember Shiv Baba! There are many precautions to take. Scarcely any of you are able to understand this. They do not even have enough wisdom to know how to behave towards the Father. A lot of effort is needed in this. To become a bead of the rosary is not like going to your aunty's home! The main thing is to remember the Father. Are you not able to remember the Father? There has to be so much service and remembrance of the Father. Baba tells you to keep a daily chart. The children who think about benefiting themselves will continue to take precautions in every way; their food and drink will be very pure. Baba explains so much for the benefit of the children. You have to take all kinds of precautions. Check that your food and drink are not impure and that you are not greedy. Maya will make you do wrong things until you reach your karmateet stage. There is still time for that. You will come to know later on that destruction is in front of you. Fire will spread. You will see how bombs fall. Rivers of blood will flow in Bharat. Elsewhere, they will destroy one another with bombs. There will also be natural calamities. The greatest difficulties will be in Bharat. Keep an eye on yourself to see what service you do. How many do you make equal to yourself, from an ordinary human into Narayan? Many are trapped in devotion so much. They think: What can these daughters teach us? They don't understand that it is God, the Father, who is teaching them. Because they have a little education or they have wealth, they start arguing with you. They lose their honour. Those who defame the Satguru cannot claim a high status. They will then claim a status worth pennies. Achcha.

To the sweetest, beloved, long-lost and now-found children, love, remembrance and good morning from the Mother, the Father, BapDada. The spiritual Father says namaste to the spiritual children.

Essence for dharna:   Renounce all worries of "mine and yours" and serve to make others similar to yourselves. Only listen to the one Father. Only remember the one Father. Do not allow your remembrance to become adulterated.      In order to benefit yourself, take great precautions about your food and drink. Check: Am I being greedy? Does Maya make me do wrong things?

Blessing:

May you become victorious in the battle of religion by giving the proof of God’s knowledge with your practical life.

You now have to come onto the stage of the battle of religion. The way to become victorious in that battle of religion is in your practical life because the proof of God’s knowledge lies in your practical life. Let knowledge and virtues be visible practically in your form because nowadays, your image cannot be proved (revealed) by discussing anything but you can quieten anyone in a second with the practical form of your dharna.

In order to make the soul bright, finish any problems in your mind with remembrance of God.

Sweet children, remove your love from all bodily beings and remember the one bodiless Father and all your limbs will then become cool.

Question:

What are the signs of souls who belong to the deity clan?

Answer:

 1) Souls who belong to the deity clan easily have disinterest in the old world. 2) Their intellects are always in the unlimited. They make effort to become pure flowers in order to go to Shivalaya. 3) They don’t have any devilish activity. 4) They keep their charts and check that they do not perform any devilish actions. 5) They tell the Father the truth and do not hide anything.

Song:

Neither will we be separated from Him nor will there be any sorrow. Om shanti. These are unlimited things. All limited things are now finished. In this world, many are remembered; there is love for many bodily beings. There is only the one bodiless One who is called the Supreme Father, the Supreme Soul, Shiva. Your intellects now have to be connected in yoga to only Him. Don’t remember any bodily beings. To feed brahmin priests etc. is a custom and system of the iron age. The customs and systems here are completely different from there. No bodily being must now be remembered. Until you reach that stage, you must continue to make effort. The Father says: As much as possible, forget all of those who have been and gone, as well as all of those who exist now in the old world. Throughout the day, use your intellects to churn what to explain to everyone. Tell everyone to come and understand the past, present and future of the worldwhichno one knows this. The past means the time when it began; it began with the golden age. The present means what exists now. So, it is from the golden age until now. The future is what is to happen. No one in the world knows this at all. You children know this, which is why you make the posters etc. This is a huge unlimited play. They create many limited false plays. The author of a play is different from the person who makes the scenes and scenery. All of these secrets are now in your intellects. Nothing you can see now is to remain; it is all to be destroyed. Therefore, you have to make very beautiful scenes and scenery of the golden age to show what it’s like. In Ajmer, they have a model of the golden city of Dwaraka. So you can copy the scenes and scenery of that and show what the new world will be like. This old world has to be set on fire. You have a map of this world and of the new world that is to emerge. You should think about such things and create good pictures. You know that human beings have completely stone intellects at this time. No matter how much you explain to them, nothing sits in their intellects. You can seek help from some theatre people who make very good scenes and scenery and you can show very good scenes of the golden age. Those people can give you very good ideas. They can show you many ways to do that. You should explain to them and ask them to create something so good that people will come and understand that there truly was one religion in the golden age. You children are numberwise regarding how much you imbibe. A body-conscious intellect is said to be a dirty intellect. A soul-conscious intellect is said to be like a flower. You are now becoming flowers. By remaining body conscious, you remain thorns. You children have disinterest in this old world. You have unlimited intellects and unlimited disinterest. We have great distaste for this brothel. We are now becoming flowers in order to go to Shivalaya. If one of you behaves badly whilst becoming this, it would be understood that an evil spirit has entered that one. If the man of the home is becoming a swan, but his wife doesn’t understand anything, there would be some difficulty. He would have to tolerate a lot. It is then understood that it is not in her fortune. Not everyone will belong to the deity clan. Those who are to belong will come here. Many reports of bad behaviour come to Baba. "So-and-so has this devilish trait". This is why Baba tells you every day: Look at your chart each night and check that you haven’t performed any devilish actions. Baba says: Tell Baba of all the mistakes you have made in your life. When some of you make a very big mistake, they are too ashamed to tell the Surgeon about it because their honour would be lost. By not confessing, you lose more. Maya slaps you so hard that all truth is destroyed (she completely destroys you). Maya is very powerful. What could even the Father do if you are not able to conquer the five vices? The Father says: I am the Merciful One and the Death of all Deaths. You call out to Me, the Purifier, to come and purify you. Both of these names are Mine. I am now playing both parts- the Merciful One and the Death of all Deaths. I am changing thorns into flowers; therefore your intellects have that happiness. Amarnath Father (the Lord of Immortality) says: All of you are Parvatis. Constantly remember Me alone and you will go to the land of immortality and your sins will be absolved. Your sins are not absolved by going on those pilgrimages. Those are the pilgrimages of the path of devotion. Many people ask you children how all the expenses are met, but no one gives Baba any news of what response you gave. There are so many of us Brahmins, children of Brahma; therefore we would all meet the expenses, would we not? We are also establishing the kingdom for ourselves by following shrimat. We will then go and rule there. We are studying Raja Yoga and so we will meet the expenses. Shiv Baba donates the imperishable jewels of knowledge through which we become kings of kings. You children who study will meet the expenses. Explain that you pay your own expenses and do not beg for anything or ask for donations. However, children only write that they were asked the question. This is why Baba has said: Look at your chart in the evening as to how much service you have done throughout the day. All of this should be followed up. Most of the people who come will become subjects. There are very few who will claim a high status. There are very few kings and very few wealthy people. There are many who are poor. It is like that here and it is the same in the world of deities. A kingdom is being established and everyone within that is needed, numberwise. The Father comes and teaches you Raja Yoga and establishes the kingdom of the original eternal deity religion. The kingdom of the deity religion did exist, but it no longer exists. Baba says: I am once again establishing that. Therefore, you need such pictures in order to explain to people. When you hear Baba's murli, you will do that. Day by day, you continue to receive corrections. Also examine your own stage and see how much it is being corrected. The Father comes and removes you from the dirt. The more service you do of removing others from that dirt, the higher the status you will claim. You children have to live together completely like milk and sugar. The Father makes you even more elevated here than you will be in the golden age. God, the Father, is teaching you. Therefore, you students have to show the wonder of His teachings. Only then will the Father sacrifice Himself to you. Let it enter your hearts that you will now only do the service of making Bharat into heaven. Of course, you do have to continue to carry on with your work etc. However, first think about your own progress. This is very easy. Human beings can do anything. Whilst living at home with your families, you have to claim a royal status. Therefore, write up your chart daily. Examine your profit and loss for the whole day. If you don’t write your chart, it's difficult for you to reform yourself. You don’t even listen to the Father. Check every day to see whether you caused anyone sorrow. The status you claim is very high and the income is huge. Otherwise, you will have to cry. This is a race. Some earn hundreds of thousands of rupees whereas others become impoverished. This is your Godly race. It's not that you have to run physically. Simply remember beloved Baba with your intellect. If you make a mistake, immediately tell Baba about it. "Baba, I made this mistake. I made this mistake with my physical organs. The Father says: You have been given an intellect with which to discriminate between right and wrong. Therefore, don't do anything wrong. If, in fact, you do something wrong, you must repent and ask the Father for forgiveness. He is sitting here to listen to you. Whatever wrong actions you perform, immediately tell Baba or write to Baba about it. "Baba, I performed this wrong action.” Then, half will be forgiven. It isn’t that I (Baba) will have mercy on you. Not a penny's worth of forgiveness or mercy is shown. Each one of you has to reform yourself. Your sins will be absolved by having remembrance of the Father. Everything of the past has to be cut away with the power of yoga. After belonging to the Father, do not have Him defamed. Those who defame the Satguru cannot claim a status. You receive a very high status. No one receives a royal status from other gurus. Here, you have an aim and objective. There is no aim or objective on the path of devotion. Even if there is, that would only be for a temporary period. There is a big difference between happiness for 21 births and a little happiness worth a few pennies. It isn’t that wealth brings happiness; it also brings so much sorrow. OK, for instance, if someone has a hospital built, he would not become so ill in his next birth. It isn’t that he would then be able to study well or that he would receive a lot of wealth. He would have to do everything appropriately for that. When someone has a dharamshala built, he receives a mansion in his next birth. It isn’t that he would also be healthy; no. The Father explains so many things. Some of you understand everything very well and explain to others. Some of you don’t understand anything at all. Therefore, write your chart every day. What sin did I commit today? I failed in this aspect today. Baba will then advise you not to perform such actions. You know that you are now going to heaven. The mercury of happiness of you children doesn’t rise that much. Baba has so much happiness! I am an old man and I am going to shed this body and become a prince. You too are studying. Therefore, your mercury of happiness should rise. However, you don’t even remember the Father. The Father explains everything to you so easily. You have to beat your head so much in order to learn English etc. There is a lot of difficulty in learning that. This is very easy. You become cool and calm through this spiritual study. Here, simply continue to remember the Father and your limbs will become cool. Each of you has a body, do you not? Shiv Baba doesn’t have a body. It is Shri Krishna who has physical organs. His limbs are cool anyway. That was why his name has been mentioned. How can you keep his company? He exists in the golden age. Who made his limbs so cool? You now understand this. Therefore, children, you must imbibe all of this. You mustn’t fight or quarrel at all. Speak the truth! When lies are told, everything is finished. The Father explains everything to you children. Make very good posters which can then be sent to everyone. When people see how good they are, they will feel like coming to see more. Those who explain have to be very clever. You have to learn how to do service. Very good teachers who can make others become like themselves are also needed. Those who make others into managers like themselves are called good teachers; they will receive a high status. You shouldn’t have a baby intellect. Otherwise, someone will carry you off. This is Ravan's community. Prepare such teachers who can look after a centre. Achcha.

To the sweetest, beloved, long-lost and now-found children, love, remembrance and good morning from the Mother, the Father, BapDada. The spiritual Father says namaste to the spiritual children.

Essence for dharna:   Show the Father the wonder of His teachings. Remain occupied in the business of making Bharat into heaven. First think about your own progress. Live together like milk and sugar.      If you make a mistake, ask the Father for forgiveness and reform yourself. The Father does not have mercy in this. Cut away your sins by having remembrance of the Father. Do not act in any way that would cause defamation.

Blessing:

May you be a great donor who fulfils everyone’s pure wishes with your powerful stage.

Souls who come at the end will be happy with just a little because it is in their parts to take just a little. So, let those souls receive the fruit of their bhavna (devotion), let no one be deprived; so, for this, now fill yourself with all powers. When you become stable in your complete and powerful stage of a great donor, then, with your co-operation and duty of making a great donation, you will be able to take them beyond with a glance as soon as you put on the switch of good wishes.

Slogan:

Constantly continue to follow God’s code of conduct and you will become a most elevated being who follows the highest code of conduct.

Sweet children, you are now at the confluence age and you have to break your connections with the old world because it is now going to be destroyed.

Question:

What speciality of the confluence age is unique in the whole of the cycle?

Answer:

 The speciality of the confluence age is: You study here and receive the reward of that in the future. Throughout the whole cycle, there is no type of study where you receive the reward of it in your next birth. You children are now studying in the land of death for the land of immortality. No one else studies for their next birth.

Song:

The Resident of the faraway land has come to the foreign land. Om shanti. Who is the Resident of the faraway land? No one knows this. Does He not have His own land that He has to come to a foreign land? He doesn't come in His own land, but this kingdom of Ravan is the foreign land. Does Shiv Baba not come in His own land? OK, what land is foreign to Ravan? And, what is his own land? What is Shiv Baba’s own land and what land is foreign to Him? Since the Father comes to the foreign land, what is His own land? He has come to establish His land. He Himself comes to His own land. (One or two people gave their opinions.) Achcha, all of you churn this point. This is something to be understood very well. It is very easy to tell which land is the foreign land of Ravan. Ravan never enters Rama's kingdom; but the Father has to come into the kingdom of Ravan because He has to change it. This is the confluence age. Neither does He come in the golden age, nor does He come in the iron age. He comes at the confluence age. So, this is Rama’s land as well as Ravan’s land. This shore belongs to Rama and that shore belongs to Ravan. This is the confluence. You children are now at the confluence, neither on this side nor on that side. You have to consider yourselves to be at the confluence age. We have no connection with that side. Your intellects have to break any connection to the old world. You have to stay here, in this old world, but your intellects understand that this old world is to be destroyed. The soul says: I am now at the confluence age. The Father has now come. He is also called the Boatman. We are now going across. How? With yoga. There is knowledge for yoga as well as knowledge for understanding. For yoga, it is explained: Consider yourself to be a soul and remember the Father. This too is knowledge. Knowledge means explanation. The Father has come to give you directions. He says: Consider yourselves to be souls. It is the soul that takes 84 births. The Father sits here and explains to you children in detail. This kingdom of Ravan is now to be destroyed. There are bondages of karma here whereas there are relationships of karma there. Bondage means sorrow. Relationship means happiness. Your karmic bondages now have to be broken. It is in your intellects that you now have Brahmin relationships. Later, your relationships will be with deities. There is only this one birth of Brahmin relationships. Then, there will be eight and twelve births of relationships with deities. Because you have this knowledge in your intellects, there is distaste for the dirty karmic bondages of the iron age. We no longer want to remain in karmic bondages of this world. We understand that all of those are devilish karmic bondages. We are going on an incognito pilgrimage. The Father has taught us this pilgrimage. Then we will become detached from these karmic bondages and become karmateet. These karmic bondages now have to be broken. We remember the Father so that we can become pure and understand the cycle and then become rulers of the globe. We are now studying. Therefore, there has to be an aim and objective and reward of our study. You know that your Teacher is the unlimited Father. The unlimited Father also taught us 5000 years ago. This is the drama. He will only teach those whom He taught a cycle ago. Many more will continue to come and expansion will continue to take place. Not everyone will go to the golden age. Everyone else will return home. On this side is hell and on that side is heaven. In worldly studies, they understand that they study here and that they receive the reward of that here. However, we are studying at the confluence age and will receive the reward of that in the new world. This is something new. No one else in the world would say that you will receive your reward in your next birth. It is only at this confluence age that you can study in this birth in order to receive the reward of it in your next birth. The Father too only comes at this confluence age. You are studying to become the most elevated human beings. Only once does God, the Ocean of Knowledge, come to teach you in order to send you to the new world, the land of immortality. This is the iron age, the land of death. We are studying for the golden age. We are studying to change from residents of hell into residents of heaven. This land is the foreign land and that land is our land. The Father has no need to enter that land of ours. That land is only for the children. Ravan doesn't enter the golden age; Ravan disappears. Then, he appears again in the copper age. Therefore, the Father, too, disappears. No one in the golden age knows Him. So, why would they remember Him there? When the reward of happiness ends, the kingdom of Ravan begins. That is called the foreign land. We now understand that we are at the confluence age. We have now found the Father who can show us the path. Everyone else is continuing to stumble around. Those who became very tired and took this path a cycle ago will continue to come here. You guides have to show everyone this path. This path is the spiritual pilgrimage; it takes you directly to the land of happiness. You guides belong to the Pandava community. This can't be called the kingdom of Pandavas. Neither the Pandavas nor the Kauravas have a kingdom; neither has a crown. On the path of devotion, both have been given a crown. Even if a crown were to be given, the crown of light cannot be given to the Kauravas. Even the Pandavas can't be given the crown of light because they are still effort-makers; they fall while moving along. Therefore, to whom can it be given? This symbol is shown with Vishnu because he is pure. Everyone in the golden age is completely pure and viceless. They have crowns of light, of purity. At this time no one is pure. Sannyasis claim that they are pure but this world is not pure; they still have to take birth in this vicious world. This is Ravan's impure land. The new world is called the pure kingdom, the golden age. The Father, the Master of the Garden, is now changing you children from thorns into flowers. He is the Purifier, the Boatman and also the Master of the Garden. The Master of the Garden has come into this forest of thorns. You only have the one Commander. Could Shankar be called the Yadavas' Commander-in-Chief? In fact, Shankar doesn't inspire destruction. The war begins when the time is right. It was said that missiles etc. were created through the inspirations of Shankar. They sat and made up such stories. The old world definitely has to be destroyed. When a building grows old, it crumbles and collapses and people die. This old world too has to be destroyed. Everyone will be buried and die. Some will drown. Some will die of shock. Poisonous gas bombs will also kill many people. It is in the intellects of you children that destruction has to take place. We are now going across to the other side. The iron age has to end and establishment of the golden age has to start. There will then be no wars for half the cycle. The Father has now come to inspire you to make effort. This is your last chance. If you delay any longer, there may be sudden death. Death is standing just ahead. People die suddenly just while sitting somewhere. Stay on the pilgrimage of remembrance before you die. You children now have to return home. Therefore, the Father says: Children, remember your home. Your final thoughts will lead you to your destination. Through this, you will return home. However, if you simply remember your home, your sins can't be absolved. It is by remembering the Father that your sins can be absolved and you will return home. Therefore, continue to remember the Father. Keep your chart so that you can know what you have been doing throughout the whole day. Generally, one is able to remember everything one has done in life from the age of five or six. It isn’t that you have to write this all the time. You know that while you were sitting in the garden, you were remembering the Father. When there are no customers in your shop, you can sit down and remember the Father. You should be able to note this down inside you. If you want to write it all down, you must keep a diary with you. The main thing is: How can we become satopradhan from tamopradhan? How can we become the masters of the pure world? How can we become pure from impure? The Father comes and gives this knowledge. Only the Father is the Ocean of Knowledge. You now say: Baba, I belong to You. I have always belonged to You. It is just that I forgot You and became body conscious. Now that You have told us everything, I am now once again becoming soul conscious. In the golden age, we were soul conscious. We would each shed our body and take our next one in great happiness. You children have to imbibe all of this so that you can become worthy of explaining to others. Then, many will be benefitted. Baba knows that you are becoming serviceable, numberwise, according to the drama and according to the effort you make. Achcha, even if you aren't able to explain the tree to anyone, it's easy for you to tell anyone: Consider yourself to be a soul and remember the Father. This is absolutely easy. Only the Father says: Remember Me and your sins will be absolved! No human beings, other than you Brahmins, can say this. No one else knows what souls are or what the Supreme Soul is. If you tell someone just like that, the arrow can't strike the target. One has to know God’s form. All of these souls are actors of the drama. Each soul acts through his body. Souls shed their bodies, and take their next and continue to play their parts. Those actors change their costumes and play their different parts. You change your bodies. There, they wear the costume of a male or a female for a temporary period. Here, when a soul takes a male costume, he remains in a male body throughout that lifetime. Those dramas are limited, whereas this drama is unlimited. The first and foremost thing the Father says is: Remember Me! Do not even use the word "yoga” because people learn many different types of yoga. All of those belong to the path of devotion. The Father says: Now remember Me and remember your home and you will return home. Shiv Baba enters this one to give you teachings. By remembering the Father, you souls will become pure. Then the pure souls will fly home. The more remembrance you have and the more service you do, the higher the status you claim. Many obstacles come in remembrance. If you do not become pure, punishment has to be experienced in the land of Dharamraj. Your honour is lost and your status is destroyed. At the end, you will have visions of everything. However, you won't be able to do anything at that time. You will have a vision of how so much was explained to you and how you still didn’t have remembrance and that your sins still remain. Therefore, there has to be punishment for those. That won't be the time to study. You will have to repent for what you have done. You wasted time unnecessarily! Punishment has to be experienced! Nothing can be done at that time. If you fail, you fail! At that time, there is no question of studying again. In other studies, if someone fails, there is the chance to study again, but, here, your study will have ended. In order that you don't have to repent at the end, the Father advises you: Children, study very well. Do not waste your time gossiping, otherwise there will be great repentance. Maya makes you perform many wrong actions. Even if you've never stolen anything, Maya will make you do that. You will then become aware that Maya deceived you. First, the thought enters the heart to pick something up. You have been given understanding as to whether something is right or wrong. If you pick something up, that is wrong. If you don’t pick it up, that is right. So, what are you going to do? It is good to remain pure. Do not become slack by being influenced by bad company. We are brothers and sisters. Therefore, why should we become trapped in someone's name and form? Do not become body conscious. However, Maya is very powerful. Maya brings thoughts and makes you do wrong things. The Father says: You mustn’t do anything wrong. There is a battle and you fall and you then don’t have any right understanding at all! We have to do everything right. Become sticks for the blind. This is the best duty of all. You have time to do everything for your livelihood. You also have to sleep at night. When souls become tired, they go to sleep. Even the bodies go to sleep. So you have time for your livelihood and for rest. Therefore, engage yourselves in My service for the rest of the time. Keep a chart of remembrance. You do write it, but then, as you move along, you fail. It's when you don’t remember the Father and when you don’t do service that everything you do is wrong. Achcha.

To the sweetest, beloved, long-lost and now-found children, love, remembrance and good morning from the Mother, the Father, BapDada. The spiritual Father says namaste to the spiritual children.

Essence for dharna:   Do not waste your time in gossiping. Be careful that Maya doesn't make you perform wrong actions. Do not become slack by being influenced by bad company. Do not become body conscious and become trapped in someone’s name and form.      As well as remembering the home, also remember the Father. Keep a diary of your chart of remembrance. Note down what you did throughout the whole day and for how long you remembered the Father.

Blessing:

May you use the speciality of being generous-hearted, uplift yourself and everyone else and become an image of support and upliftment.

To be generous-hearted means to have a generous and big heart in every task. To be co-operative in making others virtuous with your virtues, to be co-operative in filling others with power and specialities means to be a great donor. To be generous-hearted is the speciality of a generous soul. Souls who are filled with such specialities receive the blessing of success in becoming images of support and upliftment because to become an embodiment of support in service means to become an instrument to uplift the self and everyone else.

Slogan:

Keep yourself and the Father combined in such a way that no third person can separate you.

03/05/20     Madhuban       Avyakt BapDada       Om Shanti    06/01/86    The confluence age – the age to accumulate

Today, Trikaldarshi BapDada, the One who knows all the three aspects of time of all the children, is seeing the accounts of accumulation of all the children. You all know that, throughout the whole cycle, the only time to accumulate an elevated account is at this confluence age. It is a short age and a short life. However, the speciality of this age and life is that anyone can accumulate as much as he or she wants at this time. According to the elevated account of this time, you attain the status of being worthy of worship and then, from being worthy of worship you also become a worshipper. It is only at this time that you accumulate an elevated account of elevated actions, elevated knowledge, elevated relationships, elevated powers and elevated virtues. From the copper age onwards, there is the temporary account of devotion in which you do something and you instantly receive the fruit of that and then it is finished. The account of devotion is for a temporary period because you earn it and you then instantly use it. The time to accumulate in your imperishable account so that it continues for birth after birth is now. This is why this elevated time is called the most auspicious age and the age of charity. It is called the age of God’s incarnation. This is remembered as the age in which you receive powers directly from the Father. It is in this age that the Father plays the part of being the Bestower of Fortune and the Bestower of Blessings. This is why this age is called the age of blessings. In this age, because of love, the Father becomes the Innocent Treasurer and He gives you multimillions in return for one. It is only at this time that you receive the special fortune of accumulating multimillions in return for one. In the other ages, there are the accounts of receiving as much you do or give. There is a difference because, at this time, the Father becomes the Instrument to enable you to attain directly, both in the form of an inheritance and also blessings. From devotion, you receive the fruit of your faith and devotion, whereas here you receive the fruit of the inheritance and blessings. Therefore, do you continue to take every step whilst being trikaldarshi and knowing the importance of this time, knowing the attainments and knowing the account of accumulation? Do you know how elevated even one second of this time is, compared with ordinary time? Do you know very well the account of how much you can earn in a second and how much you lose in a second? Or, is it that you earn something and lose something in an ordinary way? You are not just wasting such invaluable time, are you? You have become Brahma Kumars and Kumaris, but have you claimed a right to the imperishable inheritance and the special blessings? Those who have a right at this time claim a right for birth after birth. At this time a soul who remains dependent on any type of nature, sanskar or relationship becomes one who has a right to the status of a subject instead of having a right to a kingdom, for birth after birth. Such a soul does not have a right to a kingdom, but becomes one who has a right to the status of a subject. You have come here to become Raja Yogis, those who have a right to a kingdom. However, instead of that, because of the sanskar of being dependent, even though you are the children of the Bestower of Fortune, you are not able to claim a right to the kingdom. Therefore, always check to what extent you have become one who has a right over the self. How can someone who hasn’t been able to attain a right over the self be able to claim the kingdom of the world? It is by becoming a self-sovereign at this time that you can prepare a living model of one who has a right to the kingdom of the world. When you invent something, you first prepare a model of it, don’t you? Therefore, first of all, look at this model.

To be a self-sovereign, the master of oneself means to be the king of all your physical organs – your subjects. Do the subjects rule or does the king? You can know this, can you not? If the subjects are ruling, you cannot be called a king. In the rule of the subjects, the dynasty of kings ends. If any one of the physical organs is deceiving you, you cannot be called a master of the self. Never think that there are always one or two weaknesses and that you are going to become perfect by the end. Even one weakness over a long period of time can deceive you at a critical time. The sanskar of being dependent over a long period of time will not allow you to become one with a right. Therefore, to be one with a right means to have a right over the self. Do not be deceived under the impression that you will become perfect by the end. The sanskar of having a right over the self over a long period of time will enable you to have a right to the world over a long period of time. Those who become masters of the self for a short time will become ones who have a right to the kingdom of the world for a short time. Those who are seated on the Father’s heart-throne according to the Father’s order of becoming equal to the Father are the ones who claim a right to the throne of the kingdom. To become equal to the Father means to be seated on the Father’s heart-throne. Just as Father Brahma became perfect and equal, so you too have become perfect and equal. Claim a right to the throne of the kingdom. Do not attain anything less in terms of your right to the inheritance and blessings due to any type of carelessness. Therefore, check your account of accumulation. The New Year has just begun. Check your account of the past and accumulate in your new account with the help of this time and the Father’s blessings. Do not create an account in which you earn and instantly use it. At amrit vela, you have yoga and you accumulate. During class time, you study and you accumulate. Then throughout the day, under the influence of circumstances and situations, under the influence of an attack from Maya or under the influence of your own sanskars, you use it up in becoming victorious whilst battling. So, what was the result? You earned and you consumed it, so what was accumulated? Therefore, always check your account of accumulation and continue to increase it. Similarly, in your chart too, do not just put a tick. Did you attend class? Yes. Did you have yoga? However, was your yoga as powerful as it is supposed to be according to the time? Did you pass your time well? You enjoyed yourself a lot and you created something for the present but, together with the present, did you also accumulate something? Did you have such a powerful experience? Do not just check whether you are moving along. Whenever you ask anyone how they are moving along, they say that they are moving along very well. However, check with what speed you are moving along. Are you moving along at the speed of an ant or at the speed of a rocket? This year, check your speed and the percentage in becoming powerful in everything. To what percentage are you accumulating? If it were five rupees you would say you had accumulated, and if it were 500 rupees, you would also say you had accumulated. So, you accumulated, but how much did you accumulate? Do you understand what you have to do?

You are moving towards the Golden Jubilee. This whole year is the year of the Golden Jubilee, is it not? So, check whether you are golden aged, that is, whether you have a satopradhan stage in every respect, or are you sato, which is the silver-aged stage? Your effort also has to be satopradhan, golden aged. Your service too should be golden aged. Let there not be the slightest alloy of old sanskars. It shouldn’t even be like nowadays where they make silver gold-plated. Externally, it looks like gold, but what is it inside? It would be said to be mixed, would it not? So, do not mix the alloy of arrogance and disrespect in service. This is then called golden-aged service. There shouldn’t even be in your nature any feelings of jealousy, stubbornness or trying to prove yourself right. That is alloy. Finish that alloy and become those with golden-aged natures. Always have the sanskars of "Ha ji”. You have to mould yourself according to the time and service, that is, you have to become real gold. I have to mould myself. If you think that you will mould yourself when others mould themselves, that is being stubborn. That is not real gold. Finish that alloy and become goldenaged. In your relationships, let there always be good wishes and feelings of benevolence for everyone. Let there be feelings of love and co-operation. No matter what type of motive or nature someone has, let your feelings always be elevated. To bring about self-transformation in all of these things is to celebrate the Golden Jubilee. To burn the alloy means to celebrate the Golden Jubilee. Do you understand? Begin the New Year with a golden-aged stage. This is easy, is it not? At the time of hearing this, all of you understand that you have to do this, but when any problem comes in front of you, you think that it is something very difficult. The time when there’s a problem is the time to show your authority as the master of yourself. It is only at the time of an attack that you have to be victorious. It is only at the time of an examination that you have to claim number one. Do not become an embodiment of problems, but become an embodiment of solutions. Do you understand what you have to do this year? Only then will the completion of the Golden Jubilee be called the Golden Jubilee of becoming complete. What other newness will you bring? All the children’s thoughts reach BapDada. What newness will you bring about in the programmes? You have selected the topic of having golden thoughts, have you not? "Golden thoughts and golden ideas that make you into gold and bring about the age of gold”. This is the topic you have selected, is it not? Achcha. Today, there was a chit-chat on this topic in the subtle region. Baba will tell you about that another time. Achcha.

To all the fortunate souls who have a double right to the inheritance and blessings, to the elevated souls who are constant masters of the self, to the real gold children who always stabilise themselves in the golden-aged stage, to the special souls who with their deep love for self-transformation, make progress for world transformation, BapDada’s love, remembrance and namaste.

Avyakt BapDada meeting the doctors who came for a meeting.

You are engaged in the service of making all souls constantly happy with your elevated zeal and enthusiasm, are you not? The special duty of doctors is to give every soul happiness. The first medicine is happiness. Happiness finishes half the illness. So, spiritual doctors means those who give the medicine of happiness. So, you are such doctors, are you not? If a soul experiences the sparkle of happiness even once, then that soul will constantly continue to fly with the sparkle of happiness. So, you are the doctors who make everyone double-light and make them fly, are you not? Those doctors make them get out of bed. They are able to make patients who are bed-ridden get out of bed and make them walk. You take them away from the old world and sit them in the new world. Have you made such plans? You have made plans to use spiritual instruments, have you not? What is the injection? What are the tablets? What is the blood-transfusion? You have created all these spiritual facilities. If someone needs to be given blood, what spiritual blood will you give him? What medicine will you give a heart patient? A heart patient means a disheartened patient. So you need spiritual material. All the new inventions they create are inventions created with the facilities of science. With the facilities of silence, you make them free from disease for all time. They have a whole list of all the different instruments. In the same way, you too should have a long list. You are such doctors who should have such good facilities to make souls everhealthy. Have you made this your occupation? Have all of you doctors put up such boards at your places for making everyone everhealthy and everwealthy? Just as those people write down their occupations, similarly let there also be this writing so that, as soon as people see it, they can understand what it is and come inside to have a look. It should be an attractive board. The content of the writing should be such that no one can stop himself from coming in for an introduction. The board should be such that there should be no need for you to call them, but they themselves are pulled to come to you even against their wish. Those people write "So-and-so, MBBS”, but you have to have such a board on which you have your spiritual occupation written, through which they realise that this place is necessary. Have you created such a spiritual degree or do you just write your worldly degrees?

(What should be the elevated facilities for service?) The fastest means of service is to do service with powerful thoughts. Let there be powerful thoughts, words and deeds. Let all three work simultaneously. This is a powerful tool. When you come into words, the percentage of powerful thoughts reduces or the percentage remains the same and it makes a difference to the power of words. However, let all three be simultaneous. With a patient, someone would be operating on him and another person would be checking his pulse at the same time. Everything would be happening simultaneously. What would happen if the person operating continued to operate but the one checking the pulse did that later? So many tasks are carried out simultaneously. Similarly, the spiritual tools for service also have to work simultaneously. You have made plans for service and that is very good. However, you have to invent such a facility that everyone understands: "Yes, this spiritual doctor will make them healthy for all time.” Achcha.

BapDada speaking to groups: What would be the signs of those who have been victorious many times? They would feel everything is very easy and light. Those who are not victorious for cycle after cycle would find even a trivial task difficult; they would not find it easy. However, before beginning any task, the others would feel that the task has already been accomplished. They would never question whether it will happen or not. They would always feel that task is already accomplished. They know that they always have success and that they will have victory. Their intellects would have such faith. They would not find anything to be new, they would feel that everything is very old. They would continue to make themselves move along with this awareness.

What are the signs of being double-light? Double-light souls constantly and easily experience the flying stage. It is not that they sometimes stop and sometimes fly. Only souls who constantly experience being in the flying stage, are such double-light souls who claim a right to a double crown. Double-light souls automatically experience the highest stage. Whenever any situation arises, remember that you are double-light. To become children means you become light. You cannot carry any burdens. Achcha.

Blessing:

May you be a master bestower and experience the stage of having pure and positive thoughts for yourself and others, like Father Brahma.

In order to become a master bestower, like Father Brahma, remain free from three things – jealousy, dislike and being critical – and have pure and positive thoughts for all and experience the stage of having only pure and positive thoughts. This is because those who have the fire of jealousy in them burn themselves and also cause distress for others. Those who have dislike fall and also make others fall and those who even jokingly criticise others make others lose courage and make them unhappy. Therefore, remain free from all these three things and experience the stage of having pure and positive thoughts and become a master bestower, a child of the Bestower.

Slogan:

Those who have total sovereignty over their minds, intellects and sanskars are masters of the self, self-sovereigns.
